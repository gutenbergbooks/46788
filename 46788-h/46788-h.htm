<img class="dcap" src="images/dcap.jpg" width="115" height="200" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="dcap">THE principal object of the preface in a
volume of this nature is to acknowledge
the assistance received from various
persons; the title speaks for itself, and
but little is necessary by way of introduction.</p>

<p>The material for the account of the Naval
Academy and the old Naval College has
been obtained, with very little exception,
from official documents. There is, unfortunately,
a considerable period which is not
covered by any papers to be found in the Record Office;
possibly the records of this period are in existence somewhere,
but I have not been able to discover them.</p>

<p>I hope, however, that such information as I have succeeded
in obtaining about this establishment, of which so
little is generally known, may be of interest.</p>

<p>In dealing with the <i>Britannia</i>, I have thought it necessary
to include some account of the various modifications
which have taken place from time to time in the examinations
and general regulations affecting the entry of
cadets, as illustrating the official ideas which have prevailed
at different periods concerning the education of young naval
officers.</p>

<p>Personalities in a book of this kind are inevitable, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
I hope that none will be found which could give offence to
anyone.</p>

<p>All the &ldquo;yarns,&rdquo; etc., which appear have been obtained
from authentic sources, including my own reminiscences.</p>

<p>To return to the chief object of the preface, my thanks
are due for valuable assistance to the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Admiralty, for special facilities for access to documents;
Vice-Admiral Sir Robert H. Harris, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.,
Vice-Admiral Noel S.&nbsp;F. Digby, Admiral W.&nbsp;H. Edye, Captain
M.&nbsp;P. O&rsquo;Callaghan, Captain C.&nbsp;H. Cross and the officers of
the <i>Britannia</i>, Captain A.&nbsp;W. Warry, Captain G. Mainwaring,
Captain G.&nbsp;S. MacIlwaine, Commander G.&nbsp;E. Bairnsfather,
and other officers who so readily supplied information;
Captain G.&nbsp;H. Inskip, for the loan of interesting papers and
photographs; Professor J.&nbsp;K. Laughton; Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson
and Mr. J.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D. Barton, former naval instructors on board
the <i>Britannia</i>; Mr. Aston Webb, R.A., for the use of his
original drawing of the College at Dartmouth; and Messrs.
J. Gieve and Son, for the use of old prints.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> YOUNG aspirant to naval
honours, seeking a nomination
for entry under the regulations
of 1903, was summoned not long since
to appear before a committee at the
Admiralty, to be tested by a sort of
common-sense, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viv&acirc; voce</i> examination
as to his probable fitness for the Royal
Navy; and among other questions
propounded to him, by way of ascertaining
his general acquaintance with
historical facts and personages, was the
following: &ldquo;Who do you think were
the greatest naval lords?&rdquo;&mdash;a question
which might perhaps require some
consideration even by a more mature
individual.</p>

<p>Our aspirant was, however, more than equal to the occasion,
for he replied without hesitation, &ldquo;Lord Nelson and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
Lord Selborne, sir.&rdquo; If this boy was not accepted, it
must have been because Destiny had so clearly marked him
out for a career in the diplomatic service.</p>

<p>In any case, his cheerful selection of a great Admiral
and a First Lord a century apart suggests reflections
on the vast changes which have occurred in the constitution
and administration of the Navy during this period; and
particularly, having regard to the subject of this book, in
respect of the manner of entering young officers of the
executive branch.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, what were the conditions under which a
lad could enter the Navy, in the executive branch, in the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>The method&mdash;if method it can be called&mdash;was grotesquely
haphazard; and the only marvel is that it produced
so many good officers and seamen: <em>men</em> who could take
their ships anywhere, and win against odds when they
got there. Indeed, it was the men who were feared by
our enemies; our ships were often inferior to those of the
French, but they were handled in such a masterly, cocksure-of-victory
style, that inferiority of size or metal appeared to
be of little account.</p>

<p>These mighty sea warriors, who made the British flag an
emblem of fear, were, as a rule, entered as &ldquo;captain&rsquo;s
servants,&rdquo; their friends making interest with some captain
about to commission a ship, who would have perhaps eight
or ten such youngsters on his books; their pay all went into
the captain&rsquo;s pocket, forming, in fact, a considerable proportion
of the emoluments of his office. After a time these lads were,
entirely at the will and caprice of the captain, rated as midshipmen
or able or ordinary seamen.</p>

<p>Naturally, in making a selection from numerous applicants
the captain would give the preference to his own relatives:
sons, young brothers, nephews, and so on; failing these, the
sons, brothers, or nephews of his friends would come in, or
youngsters recommended to him by persons of rank or
influence.</p>

<p>By far the greater number of young officers were entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
in this manner up to near the end of the eighteenth century;
but there was in the early part of the century an alternative
which was probably open to those who could command a
certain amount of interest. These were entered under the
authority of a letter from the Admiralty&mdash;the forerunner, in
fact, of the present Admiralty nomination.</p>

<p>It is probable that youngsters entered in this fashion were
regarded, as a class, with a certain amount of jealousy, both
on the part of the captain and that of their contemporaries.
There is a decided spice of spiteful cynicism both in the
curiously anomalous official designation by which they were
distinguished&mdash;&ldquo;Volunteers per Order&rdquo;&mdash;and also in the
more common and popular appellation of &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Letter
Boys&rdquo;; and it is quite conceivable that, when a captain had
sailed from England with his snug little assortment of young
brothers, nephews, and what not, the arrival of a smart frigate
with a batch of King&rsquo;s Letter Boys to be placed on his books
would be decidedly unwelcome; but being &ldquo;Volunteers <em>per
Order</em>,&rdquo; he had no option but to accept them.</p>

<p>No sort of qualifying examination was imposed upon these
candidates, and regulations as to age were conspicuous by
their absence. Indeed, it is here that the most absurd
incongruities existed; for it was not considered in the least
degree necessary that the applicants should be of an age to
perform any kind of duty when they were entered on the ship&rsquo;s
books, or that they should even put in an appearance on
board.</p>

<p>There are numerous instances of children in the nursery
being borne on ship&rsquo;s books, and shifted from ship to ship
until they were old enough to embark.</p>

<p>The famous Thomas Cochrane, tenth Earl of Dundonald,
whose name is associated with more daring and successful
exploits than that of almost any naval officer, was born in
December, 1775, and entered as captain&rsquo;s servant when five
years old, being kept on various ships&rsquo; books for years. His
father, meanwhile, having originally intended him for the
Army, had obtained for him a <em>captaincy</em> in the 79th Foot,
and he did not join his first ship until he was nearly eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
Some youngsters, through interest, were entered direct
as midshipmen, at a very early age. Sir Edward Hamilton,
for instance, born 12th March, 1772, was entered as midshipman
on the 21st May, 1779, when he was only seven years
old; and it is stated that he actually took part in an action on
board his father&rsquo;s ship, the <i>Hector</i>, in 1780! What part
this warrior of eight years old performed in action is not
stated.</p>

<p>Another officer, Sir Provo W.&nbsp;P. Wallis, whose long life
bridged over the gulf from the days of Nelson&rsquo;s victories to the
last decade of the nineteenth century, was borne on a ship&rsquo;s
books from the age of four, until he actually joined his first
ship, the <i>Cleopatra</i>, as midshipman, at thirteen.</p>

<p>Sir William Symonds, born in 1782, was actually entered
at three years of age, and eventually embarked as midshipman
at twelve.</p>

<p>Instances of entries at seven, eight, and nine years old are
quite numerous; and, of course, the captain drew their pay,
whether they joined or not.</p>

<p>This appears, at first sight, to reflect some discredit upon
the captains, who, it may be said, must have been aware that
they were, in a sense, obtaining money under false pretences.
It is not fair, however, to saddle them with responsibility for
the results of absurd regulations, which it was well known at
headquarters must tend to such abuses; the whole system
was a farce, and any little additional absurdities on the part
of the captains were usually winked at with the forced leniency
which is one of the inevitable accompaniments of inadequate
legislation.</p>

<p>Here, then, we find a sad lack of method in regard to the
majority of entries in Nelson&rsquo;s time, though that great man
himself was of the relatively mature age of twelve when he
went afloat in 1770.</p>

<p>If there was little or no method in regard to entry, how
did the youngsters of those days fare as to education?</p>

<p>Well, as a matter of fact, there was rather less system in
this respect than in the other. It depended in a great
measure upon the sort of captain a boy shipped with, and also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
in a lesser degree, upon the junior officers. The seamanship
of those days was pretty readily picked up by a lad who kept
his eyes open and was eager to learn; a state of war was far
more frequent than quiet times; ships were always on the
move, and seamanship came of itself; the navigation required
was of a rough and ready description, and the master and his
mates were as a rule the only people who took any trouble
about it.</p>

<p>Marryat, indeed, gives us some vivid and entertaining
pictures of the process of education of a certain kind, as
applied by the midshipmen and others to a new comer; also of
what may be termed preliminary instruction.</p>

<p>Jack Easy, it will be remembered, received some valuable
preliminary training at the hands of Mr. Bonnycastle, who
literally &ldquo;licked him into shape&rdquo; with a good pliant cane, and
who, having inculcated obedience by this stern method, took
care that his scholars should know how to use their fists; an
accomplishment which proved of great service to Master Jack
when Vigors, the bully of the mess, attempted to ride roughshod
over him.</p>

<p>Mr. Midshipman Easy is, however, far too great a favourite
of fortune to be accepted as a typical example.</p>

<p>Frank Mildmay, in his new uniform, tumbling up against
the Port Admiral, whom he failed to salute, and so humbled by
the rebuke he received that he went about touching his hat to
everyone he met, is a truer picture. Another valuable piece of
education was imparted by Murphy, his senior, in the form of a
hiding for not comprehending the significance of the captain&rsquo;s
hint at the dinner table, &ldquo;Go and see how the wind is.&rdquo;
Poor Mildmay went out, and returned, in all good faith, with
the required information; whereupon Murphy was instructed
to &ldquo;show him the ropes,&rdquo; and Nemesis supervened.</p>

<p>Peter Simple, joining as a more than usually verdant
specimen, intuitively obeyed when someone said, &ldquo;Hand me
that monkey&rsquo;s tail, youngster&rdquo;; from which it was argued
that he was not such a fool as he looked, and much was
expected of him afterwards.</p>

<p>In such fashion, for the most part, were our future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
admirals and captains pitchforked, as it were, into the
Service, to swim or sink as best they might; and many were
the anomalies which prevailed also in the senior ranks.
Captains barely out of their teens, with grey-haired first-lieutenants
to dry-nurse them; so-called midshipmen of any
age up to thirty-five; and so on. Looking back on those
days through the perspective of years&mdash;those days when our
position as a naval Power was a-making year by year, and was
completed at Trafalgar&mdash;we are apt to say that &ldquo;the world
went very well then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there existed for many years, side by
side with this rough and ready &ldquo;pitchfork&rdquo; system, &ldquo;another
way,&rdquo; as the cookery books have it, of getting into the
Navy; and a way, moreover, which was fenced about with
very precise regulations as to age, and involved a course of
pretty hard study. That this mode of entry should have
been made entirely optional, and consequently partial, seems
strange; but such was the case.</p>

<p>Anyone who is acquainted with Portsmouth Dockyard
is familiar with the appearance of the old Naval College,
standing just to the southward of the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s
house; but comparatively few people, even among naval
officers, know very much of its history, or when and why it
was built.</p>

<p>It is not clear at the present time at whose suggestion the
Royal Naval Academy was instituted, but there is in existence
in the Record Office a letter from the Lords of the Admiralty
to the Navy Board&mdash;which was a kind of executive commission
for carrying out all naval construction, etc.&mdash;dated
March 3rd, 1729, which reads as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;His Majesty having been pleased to direct, by Order
in Council dated the 21st of last month, upon an humble memorial from
this Board, that an Academy shall be erected in the Dockyard at Portsmouth
for the better education and training up of forty young gentlemen
for His Majesty&rsquo;s Service at sea, instead of the Establishment now
in force for Voluntiers on board His Majesty&rsquo;s ships; We do hereby
desire and direct you to consider and lay before us, as soon as conveniently
may be, a draught or plan of such a building as you shall judge
may be proper for the reception not only of the aforesaid forty young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
gentlemen, but also of a Mathematical Master, three Ushers, and a
French Master, by whom they are to be instructed, together with an
estimate of the charge thereof; and you are also to give us your
opinion at what place in the yard the said building may be most
conveniently erected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The allusion to &ldquo;the Establishment now in force for
Voluntiers&rdquo; is clearly intended to include the King&rsquo;s Letter
Boys only, as no other youngsters were shipped at that time
under this title; and, in fact, the completion of the Academy
was followed by the abolition of the King&rsquo;s letter, but not of
the term &ldquo;Volunteers per Order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No time was lost over the business: the Lords of the
Admiralty wrote their letter, as we have seen, on March 3rd,
ten days after the Order in Council was signed; and the
Navy Board, with most commendable promptitude, posted
their letter, with plans, estimate, and recommendation of site
complete, on the 12th; that is to say, allowing for Sunday,
they took only seven clear days about it! Probably, however,
the matter had been under consideration previously, pending
the approval of the scheme by the King in Council; but even
so, there is an object-lesson to corporations, Government
boards, and committees of all sorts and conditions of men;
for the Admiralty date their second letter on March 13th,
and the whole thing is put through:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;You having, with your letter of yesterday&rsquo;s date,
transmitted to us the draught of a building which you judge may be
proper for an Academy for the reception and better education and
training up of forty young gentlemen for His Majesty&rsquo;s Service at sea,
instead of the Establishment now in force for Voluntiers on board His
Majesty&rsquo;s ships, as also for the reception of a Mathematical Master,
three Ushers, and a French Master for their instruction, with a plan of
proper outhouses for their accommodation; and you having also transmitted
to us an estimate of the charge of the said building, with the
plan of the south part of His Majesty&rsquo;s Dockyard at Portsmouth,
wherein is described a place in the south-east angle of the said yard,
where, in your opinion, the said building may be most conveniently
erected; which estimate amounts to Five thousand seven hundred
seventy-two pounds, four shillings: We send you the said estimate
confirmed by us, and desire and direct you to cause the aforesaid
buildings to be gone in hand with, and finished as soon as conveniently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
may be, at the place and in the manner you have proposed; and herewith
we return you the aforesaid draught and plans, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(Signed),</p>

<p class="signed"><span class="padright">Torrington, Jo. Cokburne,</span><br />
Cha. Wager, T. Lyttleton, A. Hamilton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These letters are given <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</i>, as inaugurating a new
departure of great importance: a recognition of the necessity
for some preliminary scientific training for young naval
officers before sending them to sea. The death-knell of the
&ldquo;pitchfork&rdquo; system is here sounded, though faintly; like
many another long-lived system, it died hard, and even
struggled into life again, as we shall see, more than a hundred
years later.</p>

<p>Promptly as the institution of a Naval Academy was
decided upon, and plans prepared, the completion of the
building appears to have dragged on heavily. Improvements
and additions were carried out meanwhile, and it was not
until the early summer of 1733 that it was actually opened&mdash;a
very long period to be occupied in the erection of such a
building.</p>

<p>The original plan appears to have included the present
west front, with the cupola&mdash;intended for, and for a long time
used as, an observatory&mdash;with the north wing, and a very short
wing on the south side, which, however, was prolonged during
the process of building, the large study, now the billiard-room,
and a small infirmary, being added. Over the latter were
subsequently built some more rooms, including that now used
as an observatory and chronometer room. A large number of
minor alterations have since been made from time to time,
so that it is not easy to identify the rooms frequently alluded
to in letters, engineer&rsquo;s plans, etc.</p>

<p>Some important alterations and additions were made
about 1807, when the whole scheme was reorganised, and the
name changed to Royal Naval College, of which more
hereafter.</p>

<p>The original curriculum appears to have included the
following subjects: Geometry, navigation, writing and
arithmetic, French and drawing, fencing and dancing, for
which purposes the following staff was maintained:&mdash;</p>

<p>Seamanship and ship construction were taught by the
master attendant of the Dockyard and master shipwright
respectively, who received 10s. per lesson (presumably to a
class), while a boatswain and gunner received 5s. each per
lesson, and a sergeant the same amount, for teaching the use
of the &ldquo;firelock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman who made out this warrant was evidently
either a stickler for phonetic spelling or a rabid &ldquo;Francophobe&rdquo;;
a long time afterwards the Governor of the Academy
advocates the abolition of the &ldquo;buroes,&rdquo; gunpowder having
been found in one of them.</p>

<p>The existing records are for a long period very incomplete,
but the Academy appears to have flourished on the
whole, and to have fulfilled very fairly the purposes for which
it was established.</p>

<p>In March, 1748, a &ldquo;blue uniform&rdquo; was first introduced
for the students, and about the same time a detailed account
of the expenses incurred by two individuals, designated as
&ldquo;A.&nbsp;B.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hon. C.&nbsp;D.,&rdquo; is given, evidently as a guide for
arriving at an average expenditure. All the students paid
&pound;25 per annum for their board; the total expenses of the
&ldquo;Hon. C.&nbsp;D.,&rdquo; however, amounted to &pound;68 12s. 4d., as compared
with &pound;48 16s. 9d. for &ldquo;A.&nbsp;B.,&rdquo; the excess being practically, as
might be expected, in the amounts for &ldquo;mercer&rdquo; and &ldquo;taylor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many, it is stated, fell short of &ldquo;A.&nbsp;B.&rsquo;s&rdquo; total, while few,
if any, equalled &ldquo;Hon. C.&nbsp;D.&rdquo;; but in these accounts &ldquo;ale-house&rdquo;
scores are not included. This is explained by the fact
that a brewery formed part of the establishment.</p>

<p>On November 1st, 1773, a very complete set of &ldquo;Rules
and Orders&rdquo; relating to the Academy was issued by the
Admiralty, consisting of no less than forty-one articles or
paragraphs. The whole scheme had apparently been under
revision, and the entire conduct of the establishment is provided
for in great detail.</p>

<p>This scheme is of considerable interest, embodying, as it
does, the matured ideas of naval authorities at that period
concerning the entry and education of young naval officers;
and it is, therefore, given in the Appendix practically <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
extenso</i>, only the tedious verbiage being somewhat modified.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

It will be noticed, in Article XXXIV. of these regulations,
that these sons of noblemen and gentlemen, on going to sea,
were made to perform seamen&rsquo;s duties, but had the privilege
of walking the quarter-deck; while the term &ldquo;Volunteers by
Order&rdquo; is still retained.</p>

<p>Of the plan of education devised by the master of the
Academy there are no official details, except in the periodical
reports of the qualifications of the scholars, which are rendered
with great regularity and exactness, the remarks of the head
master being sometimes very quaint. One pupil is described
as being &ldquo;much too volatile in writing and arithmetic&rdquo;; on
another occasion, when reporting some irregularities, he
remarks that &ldquo;they are cursed troublesome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commissioner of the Yard, in his capacity as
Governor of the Academy, either voluntarily or by prescription
adopted a stereotyped form of report to the Secretary
to the Admiralty, which is repeated, word for word, with unfailing
monotony, with each report of progress, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray leave to remark that at this juncture there is a
pretty good harmony and agreement among the Scholars and
the several Masters; and that upon my frequent visiting the
Academy I find the latter are very diligent, and give due
attention to their business, and the methods used by them in
educating the young gentlemen are very regular, familiar, and
instructive, and agreeably to the plan approved by their
Lordships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every candidate, before admission, was examined by the
head master, in the presence of the Governor, and a report
made to the Admiralty whether he was &ldquo;found to have made
such progress in his education as qualifies him to enter
upon the Plan of Learning established for Scholars in the
Academy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similarly, before a scholar could be sent to sea, the head
master gave a certificate in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr.&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;has in two years eight months and fifteen
days finished the Plan of Mathematical Learning, and made a
manuscript copy thereof; in consequence, he is judged qualified
to serve in H.M. Navy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
There happens to be in existence at the present time, in
excellent preservation, one of these manuscript copies of the
Plan of Learning, by no less a person than the celebrated
Captain Philip Bowes Vere Broke, of whose exploit in the
<i>Shannon</i>, when he captured the American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>
after an action lasting only twenty minutes, the well-known
verses tell in such graphic style:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">THE TITLE-PAGE OF BROKE&rsquo;S BOOK.</p>
</div>

<p>This book, which is very appropriately lodged on board
the <i>Britannia</i>, is a heavy volume of portentous size and
thickness, filled from end to end with problems in various
subjects, beautifully written and worked out, and illustrated
by neatly executed sketches, diagrams, etc.</p>

<p>The title page is elegantly inscribed: &ldquo;A Plan of
Mathematical Learning taught in the Royal Academy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
Portsmouth; performed by Philip B.&nbsp;V. Broke, a Student
there: 1792.&rdquo; The subjects comprise arithmetic, geometry,
plane trigonometry, the use of the terrestrial globes, geography,
chronology, spherics, astronomy, latitude, longitude,
dead reckoning, marine surveying, fortification, gunnery,
mechanics.</p>

</div>

<p>In addition to this very comprehensive mathematical
course, the students, as we have seen, were taught French
and drawing, fencing, dancing, seamanship, and ship construction.</p>

<p>A considerably longer period was allowed for this than for
the somewhat similar course now in force on board the
<i>Britannia</i>, the maximum time being three years; and as
Broke did not get through under this, he was evidently not
among the most brilliant scholars, for not a few finished in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
two and a half years, and some in considerably less. The
master, certainly, says of Broke, in his last report, that he
&ldquo;has a good capacity, and is very diligent&rdquo;; but the fact
remains that his time in passing places him below the
average, and his work book therefore speaks well for the
Academy.</p>

<p>Broke was sixteen when he went to sea; and twenty years
afterwards, having worked his ship&rsquo;s company up to an admirable
state of discipline and efficiency, he fought the famous
duel with the <i>Chesapeake</i>, in connection with which his name
is familiar to every schoolboy.</p>

<p>There is every reason for supposing that the Naval
Academy was a complete success, but it is remarkable that
so few of our most famous admirals and captains went
through it; and there is no means of ascertaining how the
Academy boys compared eventually with those who were
entered in the haphazard fashion above described&mdash;some of
them from the nursery. It appears probable, however, from
later evidence, that many captains maintained a prejudice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
against these lads, as being still Volunteers per Order; and
we do not need, as will be seen, to go back as far as the
eighteenth century to find many who held that a lad sent
straight to sea from school was likely to become more speedily
efficient than one who had been previously trained. This
curious paradox was as tenacious of life as might be expected
among so conservative a body of men as our old naval
officers. Some time during the last decade of the eighteenth
century the term &ldquo;captain&rsquo;s servant&rdquo; was replaced by that
of &ldquo;volunteer of the first class,&rdquo; under which all those who
did not go through the College continued to enter. It is not
quite clear, however, what is meant by the title of &ldquo;volunteer
of the second class.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Naval Academy saw out the century, and went on
without interruption for six years more.</p>

<p>Then there came some &ldquo;new brooms,&rdquo; apparently, in
office, who thought that the time had arrived for extending
and remodelling it; and by way of making a fresh start, and
leaving old traditions behind, they resolved to change even
the title.</p>

<p>The reason set forth, in a memorial presented by the
Lords of the Admiralty, for these alterations was to &ldquo;render
the Academy effectual for the increased naval force&rdquo;; their
suggestions were adopted in their entirety, and embodied in
an Order in Council, dated 1st February, 1806, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;1st. That the title of the building be altered to Royal
Naval College.</p>

<p>&ldquo;2nd. That the present building be enlarged, at a cost of
&pound;4,886 2s. 6d.</p>

<p>&ldquo;3rd. That the establishment of Officers be as follows: A
Governor, a Lieutenant Governor and Inspector, a Professor, a
Preceptor, a Housekeeper, a Writing Master, a Drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
Master, a French Master, a Fencing Master, a Dancing Master,
and a Surgeon. The Master Attendant of the Yard and the
Master Shipwright to instruct in Seamanship and Ship Construction,
and a Gunner of the Royal Marine Artillery in
Small Arm Exercise, etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;4th. That the First Lord of the Admiralty for the time
being be Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;5th. That a Post-Captain be appointed as Lieutenant-Governor,
with net salary of &pound;500 per annum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;6th. That an able Mathematician from Cambridge be
appointed as Professor, at &pound;8 per head per annum, on a basis
of probably seventy Scholars under the new system. To have
apartments, and to have nothing to do with boarding, &amp;c., nor
attention out of College hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;8th. That some disabled and meritorious Lieutenant be
appointed as Housekeeper, to look after the domestic concerns

the Professor, and the Preceptor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>9th to 17th Articles contain details of the salaries of the
various masters and instructors, the total being &pound;1,443 10s.,
exclusive of the Professor, but including the Lieut.-Governor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;18th. That the number of Scholars be increased from forty
to seventy, of whom forty are to be sons of Officers, and the
remainder sons of Officers, Noblemen, or Gentlemen, who are
found qualified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;19th. That the age of entry be not less than thirteen, or
more than sixteen; that Scholars are to remain three years,

to reckon in any case towards the six years required to qualify
for Lieutenant&rsquo;s commission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;20th. That preference be given to youths who have been
at sea before.</p>

failing to complete his course and qualify for the Navy.</p>

<p>The alterations and enlargements involved in this scheme
naturally occupied a considerable time, and the establishment
was closed from about May, 1806, until February, 1808, and
even then was not in some respects complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
Meanwhile, the Admiralty were seeking a fit and proper
person to fill the important post of Professor under the new
arrangements; and, a good mathematician being required,
they naturally turned to the University of Cambridge, the
birthplace of Wranglers. There they were lucky enough to
find the very man they wanted, in the person of James
Inman, a man whose name will not soon be forgotten by those
who are interested in the science of navigation.</p>

<p>He was, to start with, a born mathematician; everything
in this line seemed to come as easily to him as the alphabet,
and abstruse problems which in other men would cause
corrugated brows and the burning of the midnight oil were to
him merely pleasant employment. He was also a good
organiser, a man of details, and at the same time of pleasing
and strong personality. Sir Henry Keppel&mdash;one of the last
survivors of old College times&mdash;gives his impression of Inman
as &ldquo;a tall man in black, with an austere countenance: but
there was that in him that I liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Life and Letters of Sir Bartholomew J. Sulivan&rdquo;
the following passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was content so long as I kept with the senior boys of
my batch; and it was a fortunate thing for me that, three
months after I entered, Dr. Inman&rsquo;s son, Richard Inman,
joined us. He had learnt the first three months&rsquo; work, or
more, before he entered, and I had nearly completed in three
months what we were allowed six for. Inman passed in the
studies that made him equal with me within a week of
entering, and then we went on competing each month.
Nothing could be fairer than Dr. Inman was to me throughout
this rivalry. He urged me to take my books home at
Christmas and Midsummer and work every day, adding, &lsquo;I
shall keep Richard at work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This shows the Professor in a very pleasing light, with his
love of his work, and his honest desire to see &ldquo;the best man
win&rdquo;; any lad who took kindly to mathematics would be
sure of his friendship and assistance.</p>

<p>Inman was a Yorkshireman by birth, being the younger
son of Richard Inman, of Garsdale Foot, Sedbergh; he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
born in 1776, and was educated at Sedbergh Grammar School,
to which institution he certainly did ample credit, for he
carried all before him at Cambridge, coming out in 1800 as
Senior Wrangler and first Smith&rsquo;s Prizeman.</p>

<p>After this he appears to have had some idea of doing
mission work in Syria; but being detained at Malta on account
of the war, he occupied his time there in the study of Arabic.
In 1803, young as he was&mdash;only twenty-seven&mdash;he was recommended
by the Board of Longitude as astronomer on board
the <i>Investigator</i>, engaged in Antarctic exploration, and
joined her in June at Port Jackson.</p>

<p>Eventually he returned to England by way of China, and
towards the end of 1807 he was appointed Professor at the
Royal Naval College, a post which he held for nearly thirty
years. He was ordained about 1805, but does not appear to
have held any benefice.</p>

<p>During the whole period of the existence of the College
under the amended regulations the official records and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
correspondence bear constant testimony to Inman&rsquo;s unflagging
zeal and energy; he was always inaugurating something new,
and it usually involved an accession of work for himself, but
this he never appeared for a moment to consider.</p>

<p class="caption">THE COURTYARD OF THE NAVAL COLLEGE.<br />

</div>

<p>In addition to his duties at the College, which were performed
with characteristic ability and minuteness, he was for
some years President of the School of Naval Architecture,
established in the Dockyard in 1810, chiefly at his instigation.</p>

<p>In 1821 he published the great work by which his name is
so well known, &ldquo;Navigation and Nautical Astronomy for the
Use of British Seamen&rdquo;; a work which for many years was
absolutely without a rival, and which he supplemented in the
second edition by the table of Half Versines (or Haversines),
which proved of immense value to navigators and mathematicians
generally. &ldquo;Inman&rsquo;s Tables&rdquo; were a necessity to
every man and boy who went to sea, and were as familiarly
spoken of as the mainmast or the compass.</p>

<p>He was consulted by the naval or other authorities upon
almost every conceivable subject which could be included
under the head of mathematics, not excepting designs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
ships, sail plans, etc.; he directed the construction of ten
ships of war, and is said to have given some valuable hints to
Captain Broke for improving the gunnery on board the
<i>Shannon</i>. He also wrote a book on Naval Gunnery, and
translated from the original a Swedish work on Ship Construction.</p>

<p>Such was the man who was placed in charge of the Naval
College; and in truth it would appear that he was to a certain
extent thrown away there, for it is easy to imagine him
Astronomer Royal, or anything else in a mathematical way.</p>

<p>The Royal Naval College was opened, as has been stated,
in 1808; and there is a considerable mass of correspondence
extant in connection with it, containing some amusing
incidents, until its final abolition, as a school for young
gentlemen, in 1837.</p>

<p>On January 20th, 1808, the second master of the old
Academy writes to the Secretary to the Admiralty expressing
his surprise and disappointment at not being appointed first
master under the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>; and, by way of setting forth
how much he is losing, mentions that he has found that the
salary and emoluments of his office amounted to about 200
guineas annually. As his salary was &pound;100 a year, the Secretary
is down upon him at once; he turns down the corner of
the letter, and writes thereon: &ldquo;Direct him to state in what
manner his emoluments arise to make them, with his salary,
equal to 200 guineas per annum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unfortunate master is thus compelled to enter upon
an analysis of his &ldquo;emoluments,&rdquo; which in truth is somewhat
lame and inconclusive: he makes the most, however, of his
&ldquo;commodious apartment, free from rates and taxes, with a
very productive garden,&rdquo; free water and fuel, etc., but is obliged
finally to complete the total by acknowledging the acceptance
of &ldquo;presents from the friends and relatives of the scholars for
his general care and attention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that his &ldquo;apartment&rdquo; was more &ldquo;commodious&rdquo;
relatively than that of another master for whom
quarters were subsequently provided under the new scheme,
and who writes to the Admiralty that he has seen the plan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
approved, and perceives that one sitting-room, one sleeping-room,
and a closet has been provided for each assistant:
&ldquo;Now, I would with the greatest respect submit to your Lordships&rsquo;
consideration,&rdquo; he plaintively continues, &ldquo;whether this
is sufficient to accommodate myself, wife, servant, three sons
and a daughter, with every expectation of a still larger
family!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no evidence extant as to whether their Lordships
attempted any solution of this problem.</p>

<p>As might be expected, Professor Inman lost no time in
drawing up a very complete and elaborate plan of study.</p>

<p>The preliminary examination required a knowledge of the
first four rules of arithmetic, reduction, and rule of three; to
write English with facility from dictation; construction of
English sentences; and the definitions, etc., at the beginning
of Simpson&rsquo;s Euclid.</p>

<p>The students were divided into six classes, new-comers
being placed according to their acquirements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><i>First half-year; or 6th class.</i></p>

<p>First four books of Euclid, first four rules of algebra and simple
equations, the doctrine of proportion, arithmetic, to vulgar and decimal
fractions, general grammar, reading in English, French, or Latin,
writing, drawing, fencing, dancing.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Second half-year, or 5th class.</i></p>

<p>Sixth book of Euclid, plane and spherical trigonometry, application
of plane trigonometry to surveying, a few propositions in perspective,
more complicated simple equations, quadratics, extraction of square and
cube roots, leading points of sacred and profane history.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Third half year, or 4th class.</i></p>

<p>Principles of astronomy, figure and dimensions of the earth, artificial
division of the globe by lines and circles, application of trigonometry to
the art of navigation and to simple and easy problems in nautical
astronomy, the use of instruments generally employed in navigation,
nature and construction of logarithms and their application, reading,
chiefly in the history and the laws of England, principles of the British
Constitution.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fourth half-year, or 3rd class.</i></p>

<p>The more difficult parts of astronomy and its application to navigation,
observations for latitude and longitude, natural and political
geography, prevailing winds and currents.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span><i>Fifth half year, or 2nd class.</i></p>

<p>Fortification, doctrine of projectiles and its application to gunnery,
principles of flexions, and application to the measurements of surfaces
and solids, generation of various curves, resistance of moving bodies,
mechanics, hydrostatics, optics, naval history and nautical discoveries.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Sixth half-year, or 1st class.</i></p>

<p>More difficult problems in astronomy, motions of heavenly bodies,
tides, lunar irregularities, the Principia and other parts of &ldquo;Newton&rsquo;s
Philosophy,&rdquo; to those sufficiently advanced.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, together with fortnightly lessons in seamanship,
weekly lessons in ship construction, an occasional cruise
round the Isle of Wight in a small vessel, and practical
gunnery, forms a pretty full programme, and argues a somewhat
optimistic and enthusiastic view of the capacities of his
pupils on the part of the learned Professor.</p>

<p>An examination was to be held every six months, and the
best and second students were to receive respectively a gold
and silver medal.</p>

<p>The silver medal was awarded at Midsummer, 1830, to
John Irving, who, when he went out in the <i>Terror</i> with
Sir John Franklin&rsquo;s expedition in 1846, had it with him. It
was buried with him in King William&rsquo;s Land, when, in
common with all the members of the ill-fated expedition, he
perished, in 1848 or 1849; was found and brought home by
Lieut. Schwatka, U.S.N., in 1880, and is now in the Museum
of the Royal United Service Institution.</p>

<p>The periodical reports show that the programme was
carried out regularly; and after some years Inman introduced
a novel system of recording progress. The total number of
marks obtained by each student was supplemented by a
second column headed &ldquo;number expected&rdquo;; this was arrived
at by multiplying the number of hours at each subject by
twenty; this number denoting the progress expected to be
made in one hour, if the student completed his course in the
full term of three years. If the number obtained exceeded the
number expected, the student might be expected to finish his
course in a proportionately shorter period.</p>

<p>This was a genuine mathematician&rsquo;s device, and was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
instructive. A glance at the two final columns of a report
practically told the whole story; and it is satisfactory to note
that a large percentage of the lads usually exceeded expectations:
in one report, for instance, the number was forty-seven
out of sixty-five.</p>

<p>Notions of discipline were severe, according to the spirit of
the times. The Professor on one occasion, reporting the
misconduct of some of the students, deplores the abolition of
the rod; and mentions that, though a dark cabin is used for
confinement, a &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; is much needed! There is no
mention of such a place of confinement being instituted; but
the Admiralty revokes the abolition of flogging.</p>

<p>In 1816 the regulations for entry, the composition of the
staff, and the course of study were modified.</p>

<p>The number of students was augmented to one hundred
in war time, and seventy in time of peace: thirty sons of
naval officers to be admitted free, the remainder at &pound;72 per
annum; and the age of admission was altered, 12&frac12; to 14 being
substituted for 13 to 16. Two lieutenants, a clerk, two
sergeants of the Royal Marine Artillery, and a matron were
added to the complement; and Latin and Greek were introduced
as part of the plan of study.</p>

<p>In 1821 further changes were authorised:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1st. That the age of admission be from 12&frac12; to 13&frac12;.</p>

<p>2nd. That no student remain more than two years, whether he
completes his course or not.</p>

<p>3rd. That any student completing his course within two years shall
be discharged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some examination papers which are extant, dated February
and April, 1822, are of the size and form familiarly known in
later years as the &ldquo;College sheet&rdquo;; and Inman strongly
insists that these papers should be circulated in the Fleet, for
the benefit of midshipmen at sea. There was evidently a
strong feeling among the authorities during the &ldquo;twenties&rdquo;
of last century that the College was behind the times; for in
February, 1828, we find more alterations.</p>

<p>The sons of naval officers are to pay &pound;40 per annum, and
others &pound;100.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Again, in June of the same year, a new circular appears,
with some radical alterations.</p>

<p>The peace establishment was raised to eighty students, one-half
to be sons of commissioned officers of the Navy <em>and
Army</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p>In January, 1829, the College was first opened to commissioned
naval officers who wished to study on half-pay;
and on April 1st of the same year appears the first report
of the Lieut.-Governor on the class of commissioned officers,
seventeen in number, registering the hours of attendance on
each day.</p>

<p>On April 14th the Professor asks for some scientific
apparatus for the use of commissioned officers, and encloses
a syllabus of their course of study, which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Euclid as far as the third book, higher geometry (including some
curves), algebra (including geometrical and arithmetical progression),
proportion, making of logarithms, plane and spherical trigonometry,
astronomy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On November 7th of the same year a circular is issued,
regulating the hours of study for these officers, in which a
considerable amount of latitude is permitted, for they are
<em>allowed</em> to present themselves at 8.30 a.m., and <em>required</em> to do
so at 3 p.m., but must leave the Yard at 5 p.m. They are to
form a mess outside, or otherwise arrange for their board, etc.;
there is to be no public expense incurred, and they are not to
remain more than one year. An extra assistant master was
appointed to assist in their studies. The number to be
admitted was twenty-four, but this was apparently increased
in June, 1830, to thirty-six.</p>

<p>The College went on upon these lines for some years
longer, but the end was drawing near.</p>

<p>On March 15th, 1835, the officers who conducted the
examinations for lieutenant deplore the deficiency of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
candidates as observers, recommend that each officer be
required to have a sextant, that a proper place be provided in
which to keep them, and that captains be required to report
half-yearly as to their efficiency and the condition of their
sextants.</p>

<p>In 1836 the abolition of the College as a training school
for young officers is evidently decided upon, as only forty-three
scholars are reported upon during that year; on January
15th, 1837, the Lieut.-Governor writes a long letter to the
Admiralty, making various suggestions in connection with the
&ldquo;approaching event&rdquo;; and on February 19th sends a
catalogue of the library and a list of pictures, with suggestions
concerning the bestowal of them.</p>

<p>Finally, on April 12th, 1837, he reports that he has
handed over the keys of the public part of the &ldquo;late Royal
Naval College,&rdquo; and recommends the staff lately serving
under him.</p>

<p>Pensions are allowed to most of these, on rather a mean
scale, and they all protest vigorously, with the result that a
few receive slight augmentation; but Mr. Tate, the Preceptor,
after twenty-nine years&rsquo; service, only gets &pound;140 per
annum.</p>

<p>In a long letter to the Admiralty just before his retirement,
Inman mentions that he has &ldquo;examined about two
thousand five hundred midshipmen and schoolmasters; a
work certainly of no great difficulty, yet one of great responsibility&rdquo;;
he disclaims any wish to make much of any &ldquo;trifling
elementary works&rdquo; which he has compiled, but &ldquo;ventures to
mention&rdquo; his Navigation and Nautical Tables.</p>

<p>He concludes by saying that he will be grateful for any
sum their Lordships may award him, which will enable him
to live creditably during his few remaining years. The corner
of this letter is turned down, and &ldquo;&pound;400&rdquo; briefly inscribed
upon it. This was subsequently increased to &pound;460; which
indeed appears little enough.</p>

<p>Inman lived for over twenty years after his retirement,
and died in 1859, at the age of eighty-three.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Keppel, the veteran Admiral of the Fleet, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
his book, before alluded to, gives some reminiscences of his
experiences at the College.</p>

<p>The Lieut.-Governor in Keppel&rsquo;s time was Captain J.
Wentworth Loring, who, as a matter of fact, filled that post
for seventeen years; and Sir Henry thus describes his
uniform: Blue coat, open in front, gold epaulettes, white
kerseymere waistcoat and pantaloons, Hessian boots, straight
thin sword, cocked hat.</p>

<p>The uniform of the youngsters was a blue tail coat with
stand-up collar, plain raised gilt buttons, round hat with gold
lace loop and cockade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cadets,&rdquo; he says&mdash;though the term was not officially
in use at that time&mdash;&ldquo;had each a cabin about seven feet
square, with a window, except the corner ones, which at
the monthly changes were occupied by those who had
been oftenest on the black list, and did not require daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The London coach used to come into the Dockyard to
take the lads away for their holidays, and it was customary on
these occasions to draw lots for the box seat. Peashooters
were procured outside the Yard, and passers-by had a lively
time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One night,&rdquo; says Keppel, &ldquo;I had the box seat; the Royal
Mail picked up and dropped boys as we came along, so that it
was midnight before we reached Godalming. The postmaster
having turned in, the mail pulled up, as usual, under his bedroom
windows. The moment they were opened, the postmaster
and his wife were assailed with peashooters, etc. The
guard was saying, &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; when the postmistress, calling,
&lsquo;There is something else,&rsquo; emptied the slops on the boys as
we drove off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Life of Admiral Sir William R. Mends,&rdquo; who joined
the College in May, 1825, reference is made to an unpleasant
feature in the matter of leave-giving. In a letter to his
mother, young Mends speaks with much indignation of the
&ldquo;toadying&rdquo; that went on, and complains that when his uncle
came for a while to Portsmouth, and endeavoured to obtain
permission for him to go &ldquo;out of gates&rdquo; for an hour or two, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
was refused, but that &ldquo;my lord this or that&rdquo; had only to send
his butler to obtain a pass for any boy.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Memoirs of Admiral Sir Thomas S. Pasley&rdquo; there
are numerous quotations, not from his letters&mdash;he appears to
have been weak at letter-writing, as many boys are&mdash;but
from those of his chum, George Rodney Mundy.</p>

<p>Writing to his mother, February 10th, 1818, Mundy says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sleep in a very nice little cabin all by myself, and always keep
the door locked and the key in my pocket. We have coffee and milk
for breakfast every morning, very good dinners, also suppers. Most of
the boys keep what they call a mess, or drink tea every night, but that
is on condition that their fathers pay three shillings a week, and it is
sent in the bill every half-year, so that it would come to &pound;3 in a half-year.
So I suppose that papa would not let me keep one. Some of
them have five shillings a week. There is a sergeant who allows all
those that have a mess a pound of sugar, a pound of butter, and a loaf
of bread every week, and tea enough, too&mdash;sometimes chocolate. One
of the boys invited me to drink chocolate with him one night, and I
must say it was excellent. The masters here are very strict indeed, but
they never flog, only lock them up in a dungeon, and have a soldier to
guard it.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am now in my little cabin with my door locked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was some years after Professor Inman persuaded the
Admiralty to reintroduce flogging, but possibly it was again
abolished; or the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo; was instituted and found
sufficient. Sir Thomas Pasley&rsquo;s biographer smiles over Mundy&rsquo;s
description of punishment, regarding it as a sort of boyish
&ldquo;bogey&rdquo;; but it was probably strictly true, the technical term
being &ldquo;confinement in cell under sentry&rsquo;s charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Mundy apparently succeeded in obtaining his
&ldquo;mess,&rdquo; and discovered that it could be used to his disadvantage.
He writes, March 25th, 1819:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I asked Captain Gifford for my mess, for I suppose you
know he stopped it a month for copying last examination. He was in
a very good humour, and said that I had behaved very well since I
copyed, but that I ought not to lay my head down in church quite so
much as I do, so I do not intend to do it any more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On April 28th he writes again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two boys of this college finished their studies the other day; they
asked me to what is called a &ldquo;blow-out,&rdquo; which is something more than
common. We had two turkeys, six chickens, a leg of pork, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
vegetables. I do call that a famous dinner. Most of the boys when
they leave this college give a blow-out on the last day, to make merry
with their best friends. There were twelve of us to demolish it. I
know I ate my share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then follows a suggestive remark, which conveys the
impression that the assimilation of the twelfth part of two
turkeys, six chickens, and a leg of pork&mdash;besides vegetables&mdash;cannot
be accomplished with impunity. &ldquo;I was invited to
another, but I was in the infirmary, and could not go to it&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Sir George Rodney Mundy was a very well-known man in
later years; he finished his active career as Commander-in-Chief
at Portsmouth, and afterwards became Admiral of the
Fleet.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Bartholomew J. Sulivan speaks in his &ldquo;Life
and Letters&rdquo; of his College days:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant John Wood Rouse (my godfather) was the
senior of the two lieutenants of the College. He had lost his
leg as a midshipman in one of the ships of Sir John Duckworth&rsquo;s
Squadron in the passage of the Dardanelles. We
stayed at Mr. Rouse&rsquo;s house during the few days we were at
Portsmouth, until I passed in. My father was very anxious
about my passing; but the questions were all in arithmetic,
except the definitions of Euclid, which I had learned by heart
the previous week. Thanks to my father having taught me
arithmetic so well, I passed first of twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No boy could get on unless he studied in his own cabin,
and at the dining tables in the evening. This some of the
senior boys tried to prevent, by watching the steps of the
junior class, and if the junior boys showed any intention of
studying they were sure to have their books knocked out of
their hands, and scattered about the Yard. Fortunately, the
one who passed in second to me&mdash;Baugh&mdash;was one of the
strongest and biggest boys in the College: he was also one of
the studious ones, and often protected me from the bullying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The collegians were often taken round the Dockyard,
and shown ships building and in dock; and if the boys liked
they could attend the rigging-loft, to learn to strop blocks and
do many other useful things. There were also large barges to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
cruise about in, to visit ships, and to take us to Haslar Creek
on Saturday afternoons for cricket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I passed out of the College I was appointed to
H.M.S. <i>Thetis</i>, Captain Sir John Phillimore, who, going round
the College a short time before, had told Dr. Inman, and I
believe Captain Loring, the Lieutenant-Governor, that if they
sent him any collegians he would refuse to take them. When
I went on board I found the captain was on leave. The
second lieutenant told me that the captain had a strong
prejudice against collegians, but that he would do all he could
to keep me in the ship. When the captain returned from
leave he sent for me to his cabin in the hulk, and told me had
never known a collegian worth his salt, and he used strong
language against the College and all connected with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not a very encouraging reception for a youngster
in his first ship; but the captain apparently soon found cause
to change his opinion, for he subsequently applied for two
more collegians, one of whom was Sulivan&rsquo;s big strong chum
Baugh.</p>

<p>Sir Bartholomew was well known afterwards as a splendid
officer and seaman, and an exceedingly clever man all round.</p>

<p>Such is briefly the history of the Royal Naval Academy
and College during its existence as a preparatory training
school for young naval officers, for over one hundred years.
That much good work was done there, especially during the
long presidency of Professor Inman, there can be little doubt;
but the authorities evidently formed the opinion that the
youngsters would in future get on better without it, and so
returned to the &ldquo;pitchfork&rdquo; system of sending lads to sea
without any previous training whatever, to pick up their
knowledge as best they could, with the aid of a naval instructor,
who was, as a rule, afforded as little facility for
imparting knowledge as the commanding officer could
manage.</p>

<p>The College, on January 1st, 1839, entered upon
another phase of existence, being reopened, under the command
of the captain of the <i>Excellent</i>, for the admission of
a limited number of mates, who were permitted to volunteer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
for a special course of mathematics, etc. They were borne on
the books of the <i>Excellent</i>, and resided in the College for
one year. Every six months an examination was held, and
the officer who passed best was awarded a lieutenant&rsquo;s
commission.</p>

<p>Ten commissioned officers of higher rank were also
admitted, to study steam, etc., under Professor Thos. J. Main,
a very worthy successor to James Inman; for he was, like
the latter, Senior Wrangler and Smith&rsquo;s Prizeman of his year.
Professor Main will be well remembered by many naval
officers still living; he was thirty years at the College, and
wrote more than one book, in conjunction with Mr. Thos.
Brown, engineer, R.N., on the marine steam engine. He
retired in 1869, and died in London December 28th, 1885, at
the age of sixty-seven.</p>

<p>The history of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth
subsequent to April, 1837, does not come strictly within the
scope of this volume.</p>

<p>It was used eventually as the headquarters of sub-lieutenants,
gunnery lieutenants, and naval instructors who
were qualifying, and a small number of senior commissioned
officers who studied steam, etc., as before. But since the
opening of the college at Greenwich, in 1873, it has lapsed,
both in title and office; no longer is it known as the &ldquo;Royal
Naval College,&rdquo; but simply &ldquo;The College, Portsmouth Dockyard&rdquo;;
no more are the voices and footsteps of Senior
Wranglers heard within its walls. Its glory has departed, and,
as a mere temporary residence for officers who are studying
gunnery, etc., in the port, the title of &ldquo;College&rdquo; can, in fact,
no longer be justly applied, save in the most crude and literal
sense.</p>

<p>During a period of twenty years after the abolition of the
Portsmouth College as a training school for young gentlemen,
all candidates for admission to the Navy were sent straight to
sea; though an Admiralty circular, dated December 18th,
1833, remained in force for some time; and in this a distinction
is made between &ldquo;Volunteers of the First Class&rdquo; and
&ldquo;College Volunteers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
On January 20th, 1838, a circular was issued to the
following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Volunteer of the First Class must not be under twelve years of
age. He must be in good health, fit for service, and able to write
English correctly from dictation, and be acquainted with the first four
rules of arithmetic, reduction, and rule of three.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems a slender equipment of knowledge; an irreducible
minimum, in fact, for a lad of that age about to enter
the Navy; and, moreover, this circular contains no maximum
limit of age; a serious oversight.</p>

<p>On February 7th in the same year the term &ldquo;College
Volunteers&rdquo; is ordered to be discontinued; but the circular of
January 20th continued in force, unaltered, until 1843,
when the term &ldquo;Naval Cadet&rdquo; appears for the first time, being
substituted in this circular for &ldquo;Volunteer of the First Class&rdquo;&mdash;still,
however, with no superior age limit stated, and it is
not until April 1st, 1849, that it is amended in this respect,
the maximum age being laid down as fourteen.</p>

<p>This is only another instance of the singularly inexact and
haphazard ways of the Admiralty in those days. The last
regulation on this point was issued in February, 1821, when
the age was fixed between 12&frac12; and 13&frac12;; the lads were then
being kept at the College for two or three years, so that they
were actually going to sea at a considerably greater age than
the more recent circular appeared to warrant. Unless, indeed,
the Lords of the Admiralty reserved to themselves the right
of arbitrarily fixing the age in each case; if they did, there is
no circular extant to show it.</p>

<p>In 1851, however, a little more detail was apparently considered
necessary, for there is a supplementary circular, dated
February 13th of that year, which lays down:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That all naval cadets who receive nominations at home are to
present themselves for examination at the College within two months
of the date of the letter of nomination; and a certificate of qualification,
signed by the professor or mathematical master at the College, and
approved by the captain of the <i>Excellent</i> (as superintendent of the
College), together with a medical certificate of physical efficiency, must
be forwarded to the Admiralty before they can be entered. No second
trial is to be allowed, and the nomination is to be cancelled unless the
candidate passes within two months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>The Commander-in-Chief is also authorised to enter cadets who
have passed as supernumeraries on board the flagship until they are
appointed to sea-going ships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These regulations remained in force until the early part of
1857, when a very radical change was introduced. And here
the curtain falls on the old order of things; how it rose on the
new, and who were the men who brought about the change,
must be told in another chapter.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE story of the institution of a training ship for naval
cadets, through which all must, of necessity, pass satisfactorily
before being allowed to go to sea, is inseparably
connected with the name of one man, but for whose energy,
ability, and urgent and repeated representations it is quite
safe to assume that this step would have been postponed for
some years, though it was no doubt inevitable in the end.</p>

<p>The name of this man is Captain Robert Harris; and
without some account of his personality and services the
story of the <i>Britannia</i> would indeed be incomplete.</p>

<p>He was the son of James Harris, an independent gentleman,
of Wittersham Hall, Kent, and was born on July 9th,
1809. He entered the Navy, in 1822, as a &ldquo;First Class
Volunteer,&rdquo; and went to sea on board the <i>Euryalus</i>, in
which vessel he served as a midshipman during the little war
with Algiers in 1824; and was at Navarino, also as a midshipman,
in the <i>Cambrian</i>, October 20th, 1827, and when she
was wrecked, in January, 1828. He returned to England early
in 1829, and was borne on the books of the <i>Royal George</i>
yacht for some time, during which, however, he was in reality
serving in one of her tenders, the <i>Onyx</i> or <i>Pantaloon</i>,
on the coast of South America, the West Indies, the coast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
of Spain, and the Channel. He was promoted to lieutenant
May 21st, 1833, and in December of the same year was
appointed to the <i>Excellent</i>, recently established as a school
of gunnery, at Portsmouth, commanded by Captain (afterwards
Admiral Sir Thomas) Hastings, who was always his
staunch friend.</p>

<p class="caption">CAPTAIN HARRIS.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1836 Harris was appointed
gunnery lieutenant of the <i>Melville</i>,
serving in her under Captains
Douglas and Dundas.</p>

<p>He was specially promoted to
commander, June 8th, 1841, for
his services at the capture of the
Bogue Forts, in China, February
26th, 1841. After studying for a
time on half-pay at the Royal
Naval College, he commanded
the <i>Flying Fish</i> in the experimental
Brig Squadron, and afterwards
on the West Coast of
Africa, from 1844 to 1846, subsequently
serving in the <i>Ganges</i>,
from which he was promoted to
captain, October 19th, 1849. He
was appointed flag captain to
Sir W.&nbsp;F. Martin, in the <i>Prince
Regent</i>, in 1851, and left her in 1852.</p>

<p>Two years later Captain Harris received the appointment
which he was destined to hold for the long period of eight
years&mdash;for it was practically continuous, though in two different
vessels&mdash;and in which he performed the valuable services in
connection with which his name is best known in the service.</p>

<p>In 1854, during the Crimean War, Sir James Graham,
then First Lord of the Admiralty, conceived the plan of
establishing at Portsmouth a training ship for young seamen,
in order to provide a better class of men to fill the vacancies
in the Fleet. They were shipped under the name of &ldquo;novices,&rdquo;
and were popularly known as &ldquo;Jemmy Graham&rsquo;s novices,&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
scheme being probably regarded with some disapprobation,
not untinged with ridicule, by many of the old &ldquo;shellbacks&rdquo;
in the Service&mdash;the usual fate of innovations, however well
conceived and beneficial. The <i>Illustrious</i>, a two-decker, was
appropriated for this purpose, and Captain Harris was placed
in command.</p>

<p>He had already, beyond doubt, an excellent reputation at
headquarters as a most zealous and capable officer, whose
heart was in his work; and he speedily proved that his selection
for this special duty was a peculiarly happy one. He
possessed in a marked degree the somewhat rare gift of being
able to combine with unflinching strictness the power of
winning the goodwill of his subordinates; and so zealously
and effectually did he perform his office that &ldquo;Jemmy
Graham&rsquo;s novices&rdquo; were soon better known as Captain Harris&rsquo;s
seamen, eagerly sought for, when vacancies were to be filled in
the Mediterranean, as well-conducted, well-trained lads,
requiring but little experience in a sea-going ship to make
them efficient able seamen.</p>

<p>Lord Fitzhardinge, writing to Captain Harris some years
later, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They came to a sea-going ship perfect in the various drills, and
were good artillerymen. You were naturally anxious for sea service in
time of war; but Sir James Graham, after consulting with myself on
the subject, came to the decision that your services, as recruiting officer
and teacher of the new raised men, could not be dispensed with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A writer in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i> for April, 1855, on &ldquo;The
Naval School on board the <i>Illustrious</i>,&rdquo; speaks in terms of
the highest eulogy of the excellent management and good
tone prevailing on board, and mentions that the captain gave
the young men under him an occasional evening&rsquo;s amusement,
in the form of easy lectures on astronomy, etc., illustrated
by a magic lantern. Describing his arrival on board, the
writer says: &ldquo;The captain is on the quarter-deck, awaiting
his visitors; he is a tall, upright, good-looking man, having an
air of much activity and determination, but being apparently
on the best of terms with those about him&rdquo;; a description
which those who were personally acquainted with Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
Harris will endorse. Probably his popularity with his subordinates
was due in no small measure to the conscientiousness
which marked his discharge of every duty. They knew him to
be incapable of an act of injustice; and while he exacted a
punctual performance of duty from every man under him, he
set them an example
which could not fail
to win their respect.</p>

<p class="caption">VICE-ADMIRAL SIR ROBERT HARRIS, K.C.B.,
K.C.M.G., AS A MIDSHIPMAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Great as was his
success in the training
of young seamen, Captain
Harris was not
content to rest on the
laurels he had earned.
If previous training
proved so beneficial to
seamen, why not institute
a similar school
for officers? The Royal
Naval College was, as
we have seen, only
available for a certain
proportion of young
aspirants for the service,
many going straight to
sea, and even this had,
nearly twenty years since, been for some reason abolished.
Why not revive a training school under a new aspect, in
which every cadet should be compelled to undergo a course
of instruction before going to sea?</p>

<p>Having conceived this idea, Captain Harris proceeded to
urge its adoption, but met with small encouragement at first.
Old officers, some of whom had possibly been instrumental in
bringing about the closing of the College, opposed the notion
strenuously, holding the opinion that a lad had a better
chance of turning out a good seaman and officer if sent to sea
straight from school.</p>

<p>The captain of the training ship had, however, the courage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
of his convictions; and an opportunity presented itself before
long of demonstrating this fact. He had a son, for whom he
obtained a nomination as naval cadet; and he immediately
applied for permission to have the boy for twelve months
under training before going to sea. This was conceded, with
the result that Robert Hastings Harris (now Vice-Admiral Sir
Robert H. Harris, K.C.B., K.C.M.G.) was, on January 10th,
1856, entered on the books of the <i>Illustrious</i>, and received his
training in seamanship with the novices, and instruction in
navigation and nautical astronomy on board the <i>Victory</i>,
under the Rev. Robert M. Inskip.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Harris was thus, as he remarks in a letter to
the present writer, &ldquo;the initial cause of the <i>Britannia</i> system&rdquo;;
for had he proved to be a failure nothing more would have
been heard of the scheme, certainly for many years.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he must have afforded in his own
person convincing evidence of the value of the proposed
system; for it was only six weeks after the expiration of his
twelve months&rsquo; training that a circular was issued from the
Admiralty, inaugurating an entirely new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> for the education
and examination of young naval officers, and including a
period of compulsory training in a stationary ship prior to
being sent to sea.</p>

<p>The story of the <i>Britannia</i>, strictly speaking, commences
thus on January 10th, 1856; the Admiralty circular, however,
was dated February 23rd, 1857.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to deal with the development of the
new scheme, it will be convenient to complete our sketch of
the career of Captain Harris in general terms, though it may
be necessary to refer to him again later on. His command of
the two ships&mdash;the <i>Illustrious</i> up to January 1st, 1859, when
he was transferred to the <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;extended, as has been
stated, over eight years, terminating in October, 1862, when
he was superseded.</p>

<p>During this long period there is abundant evidence that
he rendered most important services to the Navy, and, like
many other good men, he suffered in a certain degree through
the very fact of his efficiency. He was debarred from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
advantages accruing to services at sea, and from obtaining
subsequently a more important harbour command, such as
the <i>Excellent</i>, for which, as an able gunnery officer, he was
certainly eligible.</p>

<p>The high esteem in which Captain Harris was held by
well-known officers of superior rank and the excellent results
of his able management of the cadets&rsquo; training ship are testified
by numerous communications from such men as Admirals Sir
W.&nbsp;F. Martin, Sir Thomas Hastings, Sir Sydney Dacres, Sir
John Erskine, Sir Richard Smart, and others; while his contemporaries,
in command of sea-going ships, are unanimous in
their praise of the qualifications and conduct of the youngsters
sent to sea in the early days of the <i>Illustrious</i> and <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Wood, then First Lord of the Admiralty,
writing on July 17th, 1857, when the new circular was about
to come into force, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that, with the staff you will have, we shall commence the
work with as good a prospect of success as can be ensured, by putting it
in the best hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And writing again on April 21st, 1858:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very glad to hear so promising an account of the first trial,
and I may add success, of your education on board the <i>Illustrious</i>. I
hope that the present Board will carry out the work in the same spirit
in which it was conceived; and I am well aware that they could not
have so able an instrument as yourself in the very responsible position
which you occupy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir William Martin, then in command in the Mediterranean,
writes on January 18th, 1861:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the whole, all whose opinions are much esteemed are convinced
that you have done great good. There is no man in England whose
opportunity of doing good to our country for ages to come is greater
than yours; and assuredly the Navy is greatly your debtor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sir Sydney Dacres, on September 14th, 1862, writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I must write to congratulate you on the success that has attended
your exertions in working out such an important change in the education
and training of our young gentlemen, as the system pursued in the
<i>Illustrious</i> and <i>Britannia</i> most certainly has proved itself to be. The
last three years&rsquo; experience has convinced me of the vast improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
of the present system over the old plan of bringing boys from their
homes, often without even the rudiments of education, and hardly
knowing what order meant. I am sure your great satisfaction must be
in looking at the very small number of your boys that have got into
serious scrapes, and the manner in which, as a rule, they are spoken of
by their superiors; and I cannot conclude, my dear Harris, without
adding what is a great pleasure to me, that without exception they all
look back with esteem and respect on their captain, who was ever ready
to be kind and considerate whilst training them in the right way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those who were under Captain Harris&mdash;and there are not
a few still living&mdash;will assuredly endorse this statement; their
recollection is that of a superior who, while most emphatically
captain of his ship, exercised his authority with never-failing
kindness to all, and of whom a disparaging word was never
uttered.</p>

<p>Captain Harris, as has already been stated, suffered for
his efficiency. His request to be appointed to a sea-going ship
was, in fact, refused on the ground that he was doing such
good work in the <i>Britannia</i>; and when he was superseded,
in October, 1862, without being given another command, he
not unnaturally felt that some more practical appreciation of
his long and valuable services might well have been displayed.</p>

<p>This apparent injustice remains unexplained; he was not
again employed, and died at Southsea, on January 15th, 1865.</p>

<p>Captain Harris married, in 1843, Sophia, daughter of
Captain Penruddocke, of the Scots Guards, leaving three sons
and two daughters.</p>

<p>Captain Harris was, no doubt, consulted as to the framing
of the new regulations, and great indeed must have been his
satisfaction on finding his long-cherished scheme adopted at
headquarters.</p>

<p>The circular was to come into force in May, 1857; that is
to say, it would affect naval cadets who were to join in
August of that year. It commences with regulations for the
new &ldquo;five yearly&rdquo; examination for lieutenant, which does not
come within our scope; and the details dealing with the
entry of naval cadets will be found in the appendix.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
See <a href="#appendix_ii">Appendix II</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
The minimum time on the training ship, it will be
noticed, was three months; any cadet who felt that he was
competent might present himself at the first quarterly examination
after joining, and if he passed, would be discharged.
The maximum time was one year, and this could only apply
to cadets who were under fourteen on joining; the others
were bound to present themselves for examination either at
the second or third quarterly examination, according to age.</p>

<p>No time was lost in preparing the <i>Illustrious</i> for her
new purpose; dockyard hands were speedily at work, and
an efficient staff selected to assist Captain Harris, so as to
commence, as Sir Charles Wood says in his letter, already
quoted, with as good a prospect of success as could be assured,
by putting the work into the best hands.</p>

<p>Not the least prominent among the new appointments
was the Rev. Robert Inskip, who was transferred from the
<i>Victory</i> as principal naval instructor. He had long been
associated with Captain Harris in advocating the new scheme,
and was, in fact, Cadet Harris&rsquo;s master during his year of
training.</p>

<p>With two such enthusiasts at the head of affairs, there
was likely to be no lack of &ldquo;go&rdquo; about the start; and
although the idea was by no means in universal favour among
the captains and admirals of those days, the new step
attracted attention in many quarters, and was the subject of
laudatory leaders in the <i>Times</i> and other &ldquo;dailies,&rdquo; to say
nothing of magazine articles.</p>

<p>The keynote in these publications is the same throughout:
while approving of the general scheme&mdash;which perhaps in
most instances the writers were not very well qualified to
discuss&mdash;they all with one accord declare that no man could
be so well fitted for the post of commander as Captain
Harris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Parents may well rejoice,&rdquo; says a writer in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> (September, 1857), &ldquo;to have it in their power to
bestow on their children the results of the long experience of
a man who has passed through all the dangers of the position
with credit to himself and advantage to his country.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
The <i>Illustrious</i> was moored off Haslar Creek, on the west
side of Portsmouth Harbour, near the entrance, and there on
August 5th, 1857, the first batch of cadets, twenty-three in
number, joined her.</p>

<p>The staff was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Captain Robert Harris.<br />
Lieutenant Geo. Y. Paterson.<br />
Lieutenant Marcus Lowther (in command of <i>Sealark</i>, brig).<br />
Lieutenant F.&nbsp;T. Thomson (in command of <i>Bullfinch</i>, tender).<br />
Chaplain and Naval Instructor Rev. W.&nbsp;R. Jolley.<br />
Chaplain and Naval Instructor Rev. R.&nbsp;M. Inskip.<br />
Naval Instructor Kempster M. Knapp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not easy to obtain very precise information as to the
routine, but a good deal may be deduced from the subjects
of study, as laid down in the Admiralty circular; and the
general principle, no doubt, was alternate days at study and
seamanship.</p>

<p>The recollection of some survivors of the first batch of
cadets is entirely favourable to the ship; very great pains
were taken with their education, there was little or no
bullying, and the food was good and plentiful.</p>

<p>Lieutenant George S. Nares,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when he joined in January,
1858, was placed specially in charge of the cadets, and
remained there for about five years (in <i>Illustrious</i> and
<i>Britannia</i>), as Captain Harris&rsquo;s senior executive and right-hand
man. Before he joined the cadets were in charge of a
gunner; of course the actual instructors in practical seamanship
were seamen petty officers, the lieutenants superintending,
and conducting the examinations in this branch.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_3_3">[3]</a></span>
Now Vice-Admiral Sir George S. Nares, K.C.B., etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Probably Lieutenant Nares was as good a man as could
have been obtained for the post of senior executive. Like his
captain, he could combine the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortiter in re</i> with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suaviter
in modo</i>, and was always liked by the youngsters, in spite of
being compelled to come down on them pretty sharply at
times. He was a thoroughly practical seaman, and his seamanship
book was always considered the most complete and
useful work of the kind in existence. He also patented a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
life-saving kite, for rescuing people from a wreck on a lee
shore, which was ingenious, and perhaps deserved more
attention than it received.</p>

<p>Ideas have altered considerably in regard to discipline
since those days; and the arrangement at the time was that
the cadets should be placed in charge of ships&rsquo; corporals for
disciplinary purposes. These men were, of course, taken from
the ordinary ships&rsquo; police, and great care was no doubt exercised
in their selection; but there are obvious pitfalls in
such a system, both for the corporals and the cadets, into
which both not infrequently tumbled.</p>

<p>A corporal who was apt to be too familiar would suffer
from the enmity of some, while with others he would be on
terms of undue intimacy; a man who was in the least degree
retiring, or afraid to assert his authority when necessary,
would speedily find himself fitted with an appropriate nickname,
which would be shouted after him from hammocks in
some obscure corner of the cockpit.</p>

<p>Whether the corporals were open to bribery or not is
doubtful; some probably were, and in any case it could not
be expected that men of this class would exercise their
authority with the strictly judicial mind of an officer of
education and experience, especially when dealing with young
gentlemen who were their superiors by birth, and would in a
few months become so in discipline.</p>

<p>However, good or bad, there they were, and there they
remained, as an institution, for years, taking a lion&rsquo;s share in
the discipline of the establishment, while at the same time
some at least were permitted to keep a little store of &ldquo;tuck&rdquo;
and odds and ends, which they sold to the youngsters at a
heavy profit.</p>

<p>The prevailing impression left on the minds of some
survivors of the early training ship days is that the ship was
&ldquo;run&rdquo; by the corporals. This, however, is probably over
stating the case; youngsters are not able to discriminate
accurately in such matters, and the fact that they were
brought into more close and frequent contact with the
corporals than with the superior officers would be liable to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
mislead them as to the influence really exercised by the
latter.</p>

<p>A vast amount of power was, however, undoubtedly vested
in the corporals, who were able, if so disposed, to spite a
cadet who might be obnoxious to them in a hundred ways:
and, on the other hand, to favour those who thought it worth
while to make up to them, calling &ldquo;Good-night, Corporal
Smith!&rdquo; as he passed under their hammocks, in place of the
muttered nickname or ribald rhyme indulged in by the more
reckless. As, for instance, the following, aimed at the supposed
verdance of the corporals in the matter of seamanship:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<span class="i0">And that is how they got on in the gales.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Withering sarcasm, from some young hero who had just
learned to make a bowline knot, and climb over the &ldquo;futtocks&rdquo;
without blenching!</p>

<p>Needless to say, seamanship days were more in favour
with the majority than those devoted to the solution of
problems in spherical trigonometry or the pursuit of the
unspeakable &ldquo;X.&rdquo; The seamanship, pure and simple, of those
days contained much that was attractive to youth. Going
aloft to loose, furl, or reef the topsails; sitting astride of
the yardarm, in the post of honour, and calling &ldquo;Light
out to windward&rdquo; or &ldquo;Haul out to leeward&rdquo; in an authoritative,
if shrill and immature, voice; learning intricate knots,
and getting well besmeared with tar and grease in the process
of splicing a rope or stropping a block: all these were
welcome instructions, during which time would fly.</p>

<p>Then there were occasional cruises in the <i>Sealark</i> brig, when
the first lieutenant would take out some of the more advanced
cadets and make them work the vessel, learning to &ldquo;haul,
reef, and steer,&rdquo; like Dibdin&rsquo;s proverbial &ldquo;jolly tar&rdquo;; though
it is doubtful whether any of them could aspire to the counsel
of perfection laid down in the same song, and &ldquo;laugh at the
winds as they roar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A playing-field for the cadets was provided at Haslar;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
but what they played and how they played is more or less
a matter of conjecture, as no records are forthcoming.
Certainly, there could have been nothing like the systematic
pursuit of cricket and excellent coaching which has since
become a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qu&acirc; non</i> in every big school, and which
was to be very enthusiastically carried out on the <i>Britannia</i>.
Nine boys out of ten, however, will play some kind of cricket
if they get a chance, and the sort of cricket played by most
naval men and boys in those days was not exactly &ldquo;county
form.&rdquo; Here and there you will come across a lad who
cannot help playing cricket well, and appears always to be
in good trim, even after a long voyage; and no doubt there
were some such among the early cadets: indeed, it is certain
that there were, for there are those who can recollect them.</p>

<p>On board the ship one game in particular was in favour;
it was exclusively a sea play, and probably is not known
in shore schools. It rejoices in the title of &ldquo;sling the
monkey.&rdquo; The boy who was selected to represent the intelligent
quadrumanus was seated in a bowline-knot formed at
the end of a rope from a stay overhead, just long enough to
permit his feet to touch the deck when at rest. He, and all
the others who joined in the game, were armed with a hard-knotted
handkerchief, or sometimes a bit of rope&mdash;anything
in the form of what was known as a &ldquo;cob&rdquo; or a &ldquo;togey&rdquo;&mdash;and
the mutual effort of the monkey and the crowd was to
get in a good one with the &ldquo;cob.&rdquo; The monkey, naturally,
came in for pretty severe punishment, which he would
endeavour to repay, swinging wildly in the air as he rushed
at his tormentors, who had a good chance at him as he
swung back, more or less helpless; eventually, however, he
would get a resounding whack in on one of the others, who
was then installed in his place.</p>

<p>New comers were, of course, subjected to inquisitorial
treatment, which gradually took a more or less traditional
form as time went on and numbers increased; sometimes they
were made to &ldquo;pay their footing&rdquo; the first time they went
aloft&mdash;a time-honoured custom in the Navy, as Captain
Marryat testifies; but if the toll took the form of cash, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
would certainly bring down condign punishment on the tax
gatherer if detected; probably the exaction of &ldquo;tuck&rdquo; was
the prevailing practice.</p>

<p>Captain Harris had, however, usually a very accurate idea
as to what went on in his ship, especially while the number
of boys was small, and it is safe to assume that nothing like
vicious bullying was carried on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he and his executive officers, together with the
two naval instructors&mdash;for Mr. Jolley only did chaplain&rsquo;s duty&mdash;had
all their work cut out; the whole system being an untried
innovation, everything had to be organised <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i>, and it
naturally took some time to make all run smoothly.</p>

<p>Mr. Inskip, who remained altogether thirteen years in the
two ships, is a very well remembered character among the
earlier cadets. He took an immense interest in the lads, and
knew them all intimately, discoursing with them on all kinds
of subjects out of study hours. It was no uncommon occurrence
to see his keen, good-humoured face the centre of a
little crowd of cadets, pacing the deck with him, some walking
backwards in front, and following up behind as he went
back&mdash;many of them taller than he was, for he was a little
man, with a large heart; and many were the strange sea-tales
related during these pleasing promenades. He always
had a kindly word for any lad whom he might casually
encounter: &ldquo;Well, Smith, we tackled that chronometer this
morning, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;How does the Great Circle sailing
get on?&rdquo; He was a very capable instructor, with the knack
of imparting his knowledge to others, and many a problem of
formidable aspect at starting would assume quite a kindly
guise under his hand, as he stood by the black board and
dexterously chalked in meridians, parallels, and what not; or
came behind some blunderer and reduced the chaos of his
mind&mdash;and his diagram&mdash;to something like order.</p>

<p>One of Mr. Inskip&rsquo;s sea yarns may be given here as a
sample; it is to be presumed that he occasionally amused
himself by trying how much the ordinary cadet would swallow&mdash;or
pretend to swallow.</p>

<p>He related how, when he first went to sea&mdash;apparently in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
some other capacity than that of naval instructor&mdash;his outfitter
deemed it a good plan to place a layer of bricks at the
bottom of his chest. This appeared peculiar, no particular
reason being assigned for it. However, he went to sea, bricks
and all. When becalmed one day in the tropics, the ship
being, of course, surrounded by voracious sharks of enormous
dimensions, he suddenly recollected his bricks, and was seized
with a remarkable inspiration. Hurrying down to his chest,
he took several bricks to the galley, and got the cook to heat
them; then wrapping them up,
all hot, in a blanket, he watched
his opportunity when a monster
shark approached, and threw
the bundle overboard. The shark
immediately seized and bolted
it, and apparently felt quite
happy&mdash;as, indeed, any reasonable
shark would under the
circumstances. After a time,
however, the hot bricks came
through the blanket, and the
fun began, the monster&rsquo;s agonies
being described in the most
graphic style!</p>

<p class="caption">REV. R.&nbsp;M. INSKIP AND
MR. K. KNAPP.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Knapp, his assistant,
was an equally capable man, but
a different character altogether. Very kind of heart and painstaking
in his work, he was, at the same time, of an exceedingly
irritable temperament, and anything in the shape of
inattention or fidgeting among his pupils would certainly
bring down retribution in some form on the offender. He
possessed remarkable skill in drawing a large circle on the
black board&mdash;a proceeding very constantly required, of course,
in demonstrating problems in nautical astronomy, etc.&mdash;and
would, unaided by a string or pivot of any kind, produce,
after a few preliminary flourishes, like a golfer &ldquo;addressing&rdquo;
his ball, a perfect circle with one rapid sweep of his hand, and
then, after regarding it with a complacent twinkle in his eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
for a few moments, dot in the centre with unfailing accuracy.
&ldquo;Knapp&rsquo;s circles&rdquo; became a by-word in his class, and all
would watch with breathless interest the few little trial
strokes in the air, followed by the swift and masterly consummation,
which would often be hailed with a murmur of
applause, not unpleasing to the master. Those who used to
be in his class will recall, however, some occasions on which,
after a few preparatory flourishes, he would suddenly drop
his arm, and walk, with quick, impatient stride, round the
class-room, his hands clasped in front, the chalk in one, and
a two-foot rule, resting in the hollow of his arm, in the
other. The old hands knew very well what was coming, and
sat still as mice while Mr. Knapp perambulated behind their
chairs, until, coming to the unfortunate who was fidgeting
with his parallel rulers or some such thing&mdash;whack! would
come the edge of the Gunter&rsquo;s scale across his knuckles! &ldquo;Oh,
<em>sir</em>!&rdquo; the victim would exclaim; but, with never a word, the
instructor would complete his circuit of the room, and draw a
better circle than ever, to the accompaniment of suppressed
sniggering at the expense of the fidgeter.</p>

<p>These little amenities did not, however, militate in the
least against a very general appreciation of Mr. Knapp&rsquo;s many
good qualities, and as time went on it came to be regarded
as an excellent thing to be put in &ldquo;Knapp&rsquo;s study,&rdquo; his boys
usually coming well to the front in passing out, besides
learning some valuable lessons in repose of deportment.</p>

<p>Although there is, unfortunately, a great dearth of actual
record during these times, there is abundant evidence of an
implicit nature that the new experiment was turning out a
complete success. The letter of Sir Charles Wood to Captain
Harris, already quoted, after the training-ship had been established
about nine months, testifies to the fact in no stinted
terms; and in July, 1858, the staff was increased by two
naval instructors, Messrs. J.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;D. Barton and W.&nbsp;D. Hay.</p>

<p>Moreover, about the end of 1857 the ship was devoted
exclusively to the training of cadets, the novices being
abolished for the time.</p>

<p>Among Captain Harris&rsquo;s pupils was Prince Alfred (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
late Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha), who entered the
Service August 31st, 1858.</p>

<p>He did not, however, take up his quarters on board the
<i>Illustrious</i>, but attended daily for instruction in seamanship,
navigation, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">MODEL OF THE FIRST &ldquo;BRITANNIA,&rdquo; BUILT IN 1682.<br />

</div>

<p>He evidently retained a lasting impression of the excellence
of the instruction he had received in the training-ship, for on
March 23rd, 1862, when he was getting on towards the time
of his examination for sub-lieutenant, he writes to Captain
Harris thanking him for a number of questions and answers
in seamanship, for which he had evidently applied, and which
he states will be invaluable to him for his examination.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1858 it became apparent that a larger
and more commodious ship would soon be required for the
increasing number of cadets, the batches necessarily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
overlapping one another, and the vessel selected for the purpose
was the <i>Britannia</i>, a fine three-decked ship of 2,616 tons,
carrying 120 guns. She was launched as far back as 1820,
and was a large vessel for that time, and considered an excellent
sailer. The name has since been associated with the
training of young officers, no modern vessel having received
it until quite recently.</p>

<p class="caption">MODEL OF THE THIRD &ldquo;BRITANNIA,&rdquo; BUILT IN 1762.</p>
</div>

<p>There were several previous <i>Britannias</i>, as would
naturally be expected, the first being launched in 1682. She
was of 1,739 tons, and carried twenty-four brass 42-pounders,
thirty 18-pounders, twenty 9-pounders, fifteen 5&frac12;-pounders, and
five 3-pounders, a formidable armament in those days. She
was broken up in 1715, and her successor was launched in
1719. She was of 1,869 tons, and carried 100 guns.</p>

<p>The third <i>Britannia</i> dates from 1762, and was also
a 100 gun ship, measuring 2,091 tons. This vessel was a very
bad sailer, but was constantly in commission, taking part in
the action off Cape St. Vincent in 1797, and finally being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
present at Trafalgar, where she carried the flag of Rear-Admiral
the Earl of Northesk, and had ten men killed, and
forty-two wounded. Her name was, for some reason, changed
after this to <i>St. George</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth <i>Britannia</i>, selected to take the place of the
<i>Illustrious</i>, carried the flag of Admiral Dundas in the
Crimean War, in the early days of steam, when several
sailing line-of-battle ships were employed, being usually towed
into action by steamers; she took part in the bombardment
of Sevastopol, October 17th, 1854, and at the close of the war
was laid up, until the necessary alterations were taken in
hand, in 1858, to fit her for her new duties.</p>

<p>All being ready by the end of the year, on January 1st,
1859, during the absence of the cadets for their Christmas
leave, Captain Harris shifted his pennant from the <i>Illustrious</i>
to her successor, thus commencing a new epoch in the history
of the cadets&rsquo; training ship.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE new decade starts under the most favourable auspices,
with a new and roomy ship, well suited for the purpose
(according to the ideas of the time), and with the encouraging
results of the first two or three years to incite the
captain and his staff to fresh exertions.</p>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;it may be explained to the uninitiated
who may read this book&mdash;differed from the <i>Illustrious</i> in
that she was a &ldquo;three-decker,&rdquo; while the latter was a &ldquo;two-decker&rdquo;;
and in case this does not convey a sufficiently clear
impression to the non-nautical mind, it is advisable to point
out that a two-decker has actually four decks, while a three-decker
has five; and this without reckoning in either case
the poop, or raised deck at the after end, large enough to
afford a considerable amount of accommodation.</p>

<p>The designation of the ship went, in fact, by her gun
decks, which in a three-decker were termed the main, middle,
and lower decks; the upper deck and orlop deck, or cockpit,
completing the number. The orlop, though a complete deck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
was in a sea-going ship somewhat dark, being lit only by
small round &ldquo;scuttles,&rdquo; and the actual deck was, when the
vessel was down to her load-line, below water. On the
<i>Britannia</i>, however, the scuttles were enlarged to the dignity
of small ports. The head room was less than on the other
decks, so that a person of ordinary stature had to be wary,
while a tall man had a wretched time, the corners of oak
beams being cruelly hard.</p>

<p>The orlop deck was in these early days used as the
dormitory; all the cadets&rsquo; chests were there, and shortly after
the ship went to Portland a sort of open bathing-place was
formed at one end, with large roses overhead for shower-baths.</p>

<p>On the lower deck there were four studies at the stern;
then a large space was occupied by the cadets&rsquo; messroom;
forward of this was the &ldquo;galley&rdquo; or kitchen; and then the
mess deck for the ship&rsquo;s company, which was a small one,
only including a sufficient number of seamen to keep the
ship in order, and the seamen instructors, etc. On the
middle deck at the after end was the wardroom, and further
forward the French study. Service was held on this deck on
Sunday, and seamanship was also taught there. The after-part
of the main deck was occupied by the captain&rsquo;s quarters,
and there was one small study there also. At the fore end
was the sick bay. Under the poop was the drawing study,
and also two others; and these were utilised for some time
as a place of recreation in the evening, one of the cadet
captains being on duty there to keep order&mdash;which, if he
chanced to be one who had been promoted rather for mental
and moral than physical qualifications, he sometimes found
a little beyond his powers.</p>

<p>The cadets were roused from their morning slumbers by
a long roll on the drum. Lying half awake, in sad consciousness
that turning out time was very near, one would hear the
marine drummer come down the ladder, his drum giving out
unmistakable sounds as it touched a step or two; then the
drummer could be heard settling himself and his instrument
of torture into a firm and convenient posture against a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
stanchion; and, after a preliminary double tap, the hideous
sound reverberated through the cockpit. And it is a hideous
sound, whether from the point of view of a sleepy cadet or
a person of any station in life with a sensitive or musical
ear.</p>

<p>No sooner had this aggressive salvo died away, than a
chorus of corporals would ensue, as they marched along the
deck between the chests, shaking a hammock here and there
if the occupant appeared to have been oblivious to the
drummer&rsquo;s dulcet strain: &ldquo;Turn out, sir, turn out, if you
please! Now, young gentleman, are you going to rouse out
over there?&rdquo; Then, in a persuasive, almost regretful tone,
&ldquo;Come, sir, come, show a leg, now, <em>do</em>!&rdquo; There used to be
one corporal who indulged in flights of fancy, such as&mdash;&ldquo;Now,
sir, make a stir, do! &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s the sun a shining through the
scuttle fit to burn your eyes out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were, of course, always some incorrigibles, to whom
turning out promptly was a moral or constitutional impossibility,
and repeated offences of this nature were liable to
end with a mandate to &ldquo;muster under the half deck at
seven bells&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to come before the first lieutenant at half-past
eleven, and receive sentence, which usually took the form
of turning out an hour earlier for a week.</p>

<p>Among the most severe punishments were &ldquo;cockpit mess,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;lower deck mess,&rdquo; the former being awarded for somewhat
serious offences. The culprit took his meals&mdash;which
were of extreme simplicity&mdash;at a table rigged up under the
eye of the marine sentry in the cockpit, and various privileges
were stopped in addition. It was a particularly dreary sort of
punishment, unless there happened to be two or more brothers
in affliction, when they would make it a little more lively for
themselves, and sometimes for the sentry, who might if
unwary, be induced to pursue one of the evil-doers, who persisted
in making an excursion towards the other end of the
deck, while his companion would receive some &ldquo;tuck&rdquo; from
a confederate on the ladder, at the risk of being himself sent
below for a few days, if detected.</p>

<p>It was in the early days of the &rsquo;sixties that the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
appropriate title to be bestowed upon new arrivals was tacitly
settled. No one ever knows how these matters get decided;
but certain it is that about this period a boy arriving on
board would find himself styled a &ldquo;cheeky new fellow.&rdquo; He
might be the most retiring and timid of youths, but the
adjective was applied all the same; by way, no doubt, of keeping
him in his place, and making him understand how immeasurably
inferior he was to an individual who had entered
six or nine months before him.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the next batch he would, however, receive
a sort of negative promotion, and become simply a &ldquo;new
fellow&rdquo;; in which capacity he was at liberty to lord it over
&ldquo;cheekies,&rdquo; if they would stand it from him. Another three
months would see him raised to the dignity of &ldquo;six monther&rdquo;;
the next step was a &ldquo;nine monther,&rdquo; and at the end of a year
he would become a &ldquo;passing out number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, however, is anticipating somewhat; and it is now
time to hark back a little, and see how it came about that
a boy should of necessity be over a year in the ship.</p>

<p>The initiation of this change was actually in the &rsquo;fifties,
for it was inaugurated by an Admiralty circular dated
October 23rd, 1859; which, however, did not come into force
until April, 1860.</p>

<p>Some important modifications were introduced: the limit
of age was altered to between twelve and fourteen; the easier
form of entry examination was retained, and any lad who
failed was to be allowed a second trial within three months.</p>

<p>The somewhat lax and unpractical provisions of paragraphs
VI. and VII. in the former circular were amended. Quarterly
examinations were to be held, but merely for the purpose of
ascertaining progress; and after twelve months a cadet who
was found proficient was to be discharged for three months
to a sea-going training-ship. At this examination a first-class
certificate conferred twelve months&rsquo; sea time, a second-class
six months, and a third-class no time: the three months in
the sea-going training-ship was to count as sea time, and the
cadet was then to join his ship as midshipman.</p>

<p class="caption">THE FOURTH &ldquo;BRITANNIA,&rdquo; BUILT IN 1820.<br />
<i>Sailing into Plymouth Sound.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It appears extremely doubtful whether this was ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
carried out, at least in the fashion implied in the circular.
The brig <i>Sealark</i> continued to be tender to the <i>Britannia</i>
up to the end of 1861, and no doubt the &ldquo;passing out numbers&rdquo;
were taken out in her occasionally; but there is no
evidence that they were discharged regularly to a sea-going
training-ship; and, as a matter of fact, the paragraph referring
to this is quietly dropped out of the circular as
printed in the Navy list for March, 1862. This in itself is
significant, for a close examination of the Navy lists at that
period reveals the fact that there was a great reluctance on
the part of the compositor to interfere with the type; so the
withdrawal of the order probably came about a good deal
earlier. Certainly, from the beginning of 1862 a cadet remained
in the ship for fifteen months as a matter of course,
and was then appointed to a sea-going ship, no such thing as
a sea-going training ship being heard of at all; moreover, the
cadets who joined in December, 1860, remained on board,
without doubt, until March, 1862.</p>

<p>In establishing a training-ship for young lads, the sons of
gentlefolk in a good position, the question of locality would
appear to be of considerable importance. It was taken for
granted, presumably, at first, that the ship should be stationed
at Portsmouth, as the start was there made in the <i>Illustrious</i>;
and possibly some advantage may have been imagined to
exist in the naval surroundings, the Dockyard, etc.</p>

<p>The disadvantages were, however, pretty obvious. The
ship was moored in close proximity to somewhat unsavoury
mud at low water; there was no country, worth the name,
within reach; while the moral atmosphere of a town like
Portsmouth was not calculated to have a very beneficial effect
on the youngsters.</p>

<p>Whether any particular cause brought the question of
moving the ship under consideration, it is not easy to say;
but towards the end of the year 1861 the authorities decided
to take her away from Portsmouth; and the spot selected as
her future station was&mdash;of all possible and impossible places&mdash;Portland
Roads.</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the locality&mdash;among whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
every naval officer may be included&mdash;are aware that, but for
the breakwater, there would be practically no harbour at all,
nor even a moderately sheltered roadstead in which any
master would anchor his vessel, save with a westerly wind.
The breakwater, though it certainly forms a shelter against
the sweep of the swell in the Channel, cannot in any degree
break the force of an easterly gale; and even the Chesil Bank
does not modify to any great extent the fury of winter gales
from the south-west, though it ensures more or less smooth
water; while northerly gales sweep across from Weymouth
Bay with unrestrained violence.</p>

<p>If plenty of open air and a generous supply of ozone were
particularly in request, Portland is a very good place to go to;
but other considerations will naturally crop up in selecting an
anchorage for a training-ship.</p>

<p>As a port of assembly for a large fleet it is, by virtue of
the breakwater, admirably suited; but they have to take
their chance of being occasionally cut off from communication
with the shore for a day or two. A good many years ago,
the Channel Squadron was so cut off during the best part of
a week, while an easterly gale was raging; only one vessel,
favourably situated, contriving to send in a cutter under a
close-reefed sail, from the stern, the crew and officer using the
rope ladder suspended from the taffrail.</p>

<p>There was no possibility of acquiring ground for decent
playing fields; the island&mdash;so called&mdash;of Portland presented
no great attractions for walking or anything else; there was a
stupid little town, with one steep street, climbing up the hill;
and Weymouth was too far off for landing the cadets, save on
exceptional occasions, and when they got there, there was
little or nothing to do, except get into possible mischief.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these drawbacks, however, Portland was
determined upon; and when the cadets rejoined on February
2nd, 1862, after their Christmas leave, they found their floating
home in the unwonted bustle of &ldquo;preparing for sea&rdquo;;
and a very welcome distraction it proved to them, in place of
the ordinary hum-drum of alternate &ldquo;seamanship&rdquo; and
&ldquo;study&rdquo; days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
By February 6th all preparations were complete; at
3 p.m. a lumbering dockyard tug, the <i>Lucifer</i>, took the
<i>Britannia</i> in tow, and slowly dragged her out of the familiar
harbour, making for the eastern end of the Isle of Wight.
The voyage was not, however, to be made alone; at Spithead
the <i>Trafalgar</i>, steam two-decker, was in waiting, and took her
station about half a mile astern of the <i>Britannia</i>, where she
hovered during the whole passage, in case of any accident.
The undertaking was not, indeed, without some risk, at that
season, and anything in the shape of a gale would have been
serious; the ship &ldquo;flying light,&rdquo; with small frigate&rsquo;s spars,
and with only a handful of bluejackets and a few dockyard
riggers on board.</p>

<p>However, the fates proved propitious; the wind blew fair
from east-north-east, the sea was smooth, and none of the
cadets were seasick; though they had the unwonted experience,
afterwards to become so familiar, of hearing the
gentle complaining &ldquo;creech&rdquo; of the oak timbers, and the
rattle of small-arms and other odds and ends in the racks,
with the slight motion of the ship.</p>

<p>In the small hours of the morning it was decided to
utilise the fair wind, which was freshening a bit, by making
sail, and dispensing with the services of the tug. Accordingly,
the jib was hoisted, the topsails loosed and the sheets
dragged home; there was not enough &ldquo;beef,&rdquo; as Jack would
say, to hoist them, so they bellied out, all loose and baggy,
with the following breeze, a sorry sight for a man-o&rsquo;-warsman;
that smart seaman, Captain Harris, must have found it go
sorely against the grain to leave them so. He had a certain
compensation, however; for no sooner did she feel the old
familiar pressure on the masts, than the <i>Britannia</i> asserted
herself as a ship with a reputation under canvas, and came
tumbling after the tug, which had just been cast off, and
whose best speed, unencumbered, was probably about six
knots, in such lively fashion that she almost ran over
her.</p>

<p>Along the chalk cliffs from St. Alban&rsquo;s Head the little
squadron passed in the dim light of early morning, the long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
snake-like breakwater, and the wedge-shaped island of
Portland gradually showing up more clearly.</p>

<p>The cadets began to come up in twos and threes, their
hands stuffed well into the pockets of their monkey jackets;
soon, however, they were summoned to &ldquo;bring ship to an
anchor,&rdquo; as the <i>Britannia</i>, with the <i>Trafalgar</i> still in close
attendance, rounded the breakwater and approached her
moorings, already laid down. Not even Captain Harris,
however, would venture on the experiment of picking up
moorings of this class under sail, in a three-decker, jury rigged,
with her topsails on the cap; so the anchor was in readiness
for letting go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fourth division, up on the poop, and man the spanker
outhaul!&rdquo; Up they went, and realised immediately how
extremely cold a fresh east wind can be on a February morning,
as they held the rope in their benumbed fingers
awaiting the order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul out the spanker! Hard down with the helm!&rdquo;
and the <i>Britannia</i> gracefully rounded to, topsails all shaking;
as she lost her way, the anchor splashed, the cable rumbled
out, and she brought up, close to the dockyard &ldquo;lump&rdquo;
supporting the heavy moorings.</p>

<p>In such fashion was the arrival of the <i>Britannia</i> on her
new station; and as the present writer happened to be one of
the fourth division above referred to, and has a vivid recollection
of that morning&mdash;particularly of the biting wind&mdash;the
account may be taken as moderately accurate.</p>

<p>The cadets were sent for a run on shore in the afternoon,
while the dockyard men, assisted by a party of seamen from
the <i>Trafalgar</i>, got in the moorings.</p>

<p>Of the period at Portland&mdash;which, as will be seen, was not
very long&mdash;the principal characteristic was its monotony.
All the cadets who were in the <i>Britannia</i> during that time
will probably agree in this. There was but little fun to be
got out of Fortune&rsquo;s Well, as the village was called; and even
the &ldquo;tuck&rdquo; was indifferent&mdash;a man used to come to the
field with ices and various unwholesome stuffs in the summer;
there was not much cricket or football worthy the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
True, there were the &ldquo;blue gigs&rdquo;; they were greatly
in demand in fine weather, but in such an exposed place
a very moderate amount of wind would render their use
impossible; the sailing launch was rarely used except for
instructional purposes. The captains&mdash;twelve in number&mdash;were
allowed to visit Weymouth on half-holidays, but the
remainder only on rare occasions.</p>

<p>A small steamer used to come alongside to take the
cadets on shore to Portland, and a larger one, plying regularly
to Weymouth, would call when required to take cadets or
officers there.</p>

<p>Among the amusements indulged in by some of the more
adventurous among the cadets was the search after sea-birds&rsquo;
eggs on the cliffs at the west side of Portland; and this
resulted, not very long after the arrival of the ship, in a sad
fatality, a cadet named Cox losing his life by a fall from the
cliff.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the drawbacks of Portland as
a station, the captain and his staff pursued the chief end and
aim of the establishment with unremitting vigour, and great
success. Seamanship and navigation were thoroughly well
taught, and any lad who was even moderately industrious
might go to sea with every detail of standing and running
rigging, reefing and furling, etc., at his fingers&rsquo; ends, only
needing a little experience afloat to render him&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malgr&eacute;</i> the
prophecies of the malcontents of the old school&mdash;a most
useful young officer. Some of them were very respectable
boat-sailers as well; while all were able to take a tolerably
accurate observation for latitude or longitude, and work it out
correctly: no mean equipment with which to start in a sea-going
ship.</p>

<p>The weak part of the scheme was in French and drawing,
as it usually was in those days in almost all educational
establishments.</p>

<p>The drawing-master, though an accomplished draughtsman,
did not appear to have much idea of imparting
his knowledge to his pupils; systematic teaching in
form and perspective was unknown; so that a lad who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
possessed considerable natural talent in this direction usually
found himself at the end just about where he was at the
beginning.</p>

<p>Of the French instruction it can only be said that it is
difficult to conceive how such a farce could be permitted to
drag on year after year. The French lesson was a time for
every mountebank trick imaginable, little heed being paid to
the half-hearted remonstrances of the good-natured professor.
It would commence with some feeble attempt at one of
Ollendorf&rsquo;s exercises, which, of course, contain abundant
material of merriment for the youthful mind.</p>

<p>Sometimes the professor would press for a little more
variety; and was invariably met either with &ldquo;Avez vous etez
on board le <i>Colossus</i>?&rdquo; (the guardship at Portland), or &ldquo;Avez
vous etez a Weymouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a cadet at one time who possessed an abnormal
development in the matter of aural appendages; and who,
moreover, was able to fold his ears in, and cause each in
succession suddenly to unfold. His appearance was naturally
most grotesque under these circumstances, and his performances
in the French study were a source of unfailing joy
to his companions. He would &ldquo;furl&rdquo; his ears before
commencing the stereotyped conversation with the professor,
and solemnly let one out in the middle, gazing
at the master meanwhile with an expression of childlike
innocence.</p>

<p>Among the evening recreations, in the winter especially,
there were frequently songs and choruses in the messroom,
particularly if there happened to be one or two cadets with
an aptitude for singing and a good repertoire of songs. There
was one lad there in the latter part of the year 1862 who
was remarkable in this respect, and his songs were always in
request. One of the prime favourites was an extraordinary
&ldquo;descriptive&rdquo; ballad about a certain &ldquo;King of Otaheit&eacute;,&rdquo; in
which a variety of well-known airs were introduced. As it is
probably quite out of date and unknown to our readers
of the present generation, it shall be immortalised in these
pages.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brave Broke&rdquo; of the <i>Shannon</i> was as popular as in
&ldquo;Tom Brown&rsquo;s Schooldays&rdquo;; and there was a youth&mdash;said to
be partially of Swiss extraction&mdash;who gave a song with a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
piercing &ldquo;yodel&rdquo; to each verse; and there were a great
many verses. The other cadets greatly envied him this
accomplishment, and the messroom would sometimes resound
with embryo endeavours to produce a similar result;
causing, on one occasion, a sudden eruption of the lieutenant
on duty, who blew a boatswain&rsquo;s whistle to attract attention,
and declared that a repetition of these singular noises would
involve a muster of the cadets on deck.</p>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i> was, as has been stated, fully rigged in
those days; and the cadets were allowed, and encouraged, to
go aloft at all times: the &ldquo;cheeky new fellows,&rdquo; indeed, had
to go over the topmast head every morning, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</i>.</p>

<p>In summer there were always a number of lads climbing
about on the mainmast and mizenmast, and the more active
and venturesome used to compete with one another in the
performance of sundry more or less dangerous feats. One
cadet endeavoured to immortalise himself by coming down
over the &ldquo;futtocks&rdquo; with one arm and one leg. Probably the
reader is aware that the &ldquo;futtock shrouds&rdquo; are the short, stiff,
standing ropes from the edge of the &ldquo;top,&rdquo; the traversing of
which involves a more or less reversed position; it is easy
enough for any ordinarily active boy, and the alternative, of
going through &ldquo;lubber&rsquo;s hole,&rdquo; was regarded as more or less
of a disgrace. It will be obvious, however, that the full complement
of limbs is essential to the safe passage of the &ldquo;futtocks&rdquo;;
a fact which was forcibly impressed upon our young
hero by a very hasty involuntary descent into the main
chains, resulting in concussion of the brain and a pretty bad
scalp wound. However, he came up smiling after a week or
so; but did not try it again.</p>

<p>Another aspirant for celebrity conceived the idea of
coming down the mizen royal stay &ldquo;hand over leg&rdquo;; this
stay being a very small rope, and&mdash;as it was not called upon
to stand the stress of sail&mdash;certainly a pretty old one, it was
quite on the cards that it might have given way, especially as
the gymnast was a good lump of a boy. However, he escaped,
and landed in the main-top triumphantly; whence he was
called down by the first lieutenant, admonished as a &ldquo;young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>

fool,&rdquo; and received some slight punishment, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pour encourager
les autres</i>.</p>

<p>A favourite pastime was sliding down the two parts of the
topsail halyards, which passed through a great block within
reach of the main-top. You got hold of the two ropes, which
ran parallel, about a foot apart, to the bulwarks, one in each
hand, twisted your legs round them, and then, embracing the
ropes with your arms so as to avoid skinning your hands,
down you went like a flash. It was advisable, however, to
tie your trousers round the ankles first, or they rucked up
and the friction of the rope would inflict a very nasty burn
on the leg; one cadet, in fact, was on the sick-list for a considerable
time as the result of this man&oelig;uvre.</p>

<p>Dear old Dibdin tells us how William, the favoured of
Black-eyed Susan, was aloft when she came alongside; upon
which,</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<span class="i0">The cord glides swiftly through his glowing hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quick as lightning on the deck he stands.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No cadet, certainly, except a very green &ldquo;cheeky new fellow,&rdquo;
would try this experiment, knowing that he would arrive on
deck with a good deal more than the cuticle burnt off his
&ldquo;glowing hands&rdquo;; William, however, came down by &ldquo;poetical
licence,&rdquo; which no doubt makes all the difference.</p>

<p>If the cadet&rsquo;s cuticle escaped, however, the clothes, which
his parents paid for, did not!</p>

<p>On a fine half-holiday those who did not wish to go on
shore would often spend the time aloft with a book; many an
hour has the present writer spent at the main-yardarm,
where the studding-sail boom afforded a seat of more or less
comfort and security, with a book; one arm clasping the
lift, legs hanging down below the yard. It probably never
occurs to youth that to doze off in such a position would
certainly be fatal!</p>

<p>The year 1862 was an eventful one for the <i>Britannia</i>, two
most important figures disappearing from her history.</p>

<p>It became known in September that Captain Harris was
to leave shortly, and the news came as a sort of shock, he was
so completely identified with the institution. The report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
turned out to be true, and on October 1st he was succeeded
by Captain Richard Ashmore Powell. This officer had, in a
letter to Captain Harris, dated May 27th of the same year,
written as follows: &ldquo;I am much pleased with the lads from
the <i>Britannia</i>; they are well behaved, and are well grounded
in the fundamental parts of their profession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had now to try his hand at turning out similar
youngsters, and, though he found the way paved for him by
the results of his predecessor&rsquo;s forethought and experience, he
probably felt that he had his work cut out.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Lieutenant Nares was promoted to
commander, and, though he retained his post as senior executive
for a time, he was superseded in December by Commander
William H. Edye,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a very smart and energetic officer,
who was held in great respect by the cadets.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_4_4">[4]</a></span>
Now Admiral W.&nbsp;H. Edye.</p>
</div>

<p>Nares&rsquo; departure was doubtless a great loss to the ship;
he identified himself very heartily with the cadets in their
games, etc., and displayed remarkable activity in playing
&ldquo;Sling the Monkey&rdquo; and &ldquo;High Cockolorum&rdquo; with them.</p>

<p>A very pleasant reminiscence in connection with him is an
excursion which he &ldquo;personally conducted&rdquo; at Easter, 1862,
taking about fifty cadets, whose homes were too far distant
for them to avail themselves of the brief holidays, for a
three or four days&rsquo; trip to Wells, Glastonbury, Cheddar, etc.
The boys thoroughly enjoyed themselves, and made a good
show at the service in Wells Cathedral on Easter Sunday,
where the preacher &ldquo;gie&rsquo;d &rsquo;em a sight o&rsquo; gude advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On one occasion a number of the cadets were on the
west side of Chesil Bank, watching the rollers coming in after
a heavy gale: a very fine sight. The beach&mdash;entirely composed
of large loose pebbles&mdash;runs down steeply, so that the
sea breaks in one great &ldquo;comber,&rdquo; coming in like a wall, and
dragging back the pebbles in the &ldquo;undertow&rdquo; with a tremendous
clatter. Some of the lads thought it good fun to
run down after the receding wave, as far as they dared, right
under the next advancing one; a most dangerous amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Lieutenant Nares unexpectedly came on the scene, and,
arming himself with a long piece of tough seaweed, something
like a South African sjambok, he gave chase, and scored
heavily off several, being very fleet of foot. Having afforded
this practical proof of the probable consequences of being
caught at such games, he gave them a lecture as to the far
more serious results of losing their footing, or being dragged
out by the undertow&mdash;which, indeed, one or two had narrowly
escaped.</p>

<p>It was not long after the appointment of Captain Powell
that the Admiralty decided to introduce corporal punishment
for serious offences among the cadets. It is not quite clear
at the present time what gave rise to this innovation, but
there were probably some unusually reckless spirits among
the youngsters, of whom it was deemed necessary to make an
example.</p>

<p>There was considerable awe among the cadets the first
time they were assembled to &ldquo;witness punishment&rdquo;&mdash;for it
was publicly inflicted&mdash;and the culprit was lashed, in true
man-o&rsquo;-war fashion, on one side of the deck, facing a port,
while his comrades were drawn up opposite.</p>

<p>The deterrent effect was probably somewhat discounted by
the amazing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i> of the young gentleman under punishment,
who took his birching without a murmur, and, having
a good view of Portland Roads through the port, had apparently
been interesting himself in the man&oelig;uvres of a
merchant vessel which was beating in; for, as the last stroke
was given, and the corporal advanced to release him, he
remarked, in a genial, conversational tone, &ldquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s missed
stays! I thought she would!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This lad naturally became rather a hero in the eyes of his
fellows, especially as he was already rather a favourite, being
of the breezy type, which sailors call a &ldquo;Jack-shilloo.&rdquo; It
must be said, however, that birchings were few and far
between, at least in the days of Captain Powell.</p>

<p>In March, 1863, came the marriage of the Prince of
Wales, the day being observed as a holiday, and white
&ldquo;favours,&rdquo; with the portraits of the Prince and of Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
Alexandra on them, were distributed to the cadets, who were
also allowed leave to go to Weymouth&mdash;though they found
nothing particularly amusing to do there. Indeed, a more
uninteresting town for a lad to spend some hours in could not
well be imagined.</p>

<p>The numerous disabilities of Portland began about this
period to be brought home to the Admiralty, chiefly through
the representations of Captain Powell, who eventually
received instructions to look round for a more suitable
station. In recommending Dartmouth he probably made the
best selection possible. The only objection that could be
raised to it was that it might not be sufficiently bracing, and
this was more or less of a &ldquo;faddy&rdquo; idea; in all other respects
it appeared&mdash;and has proved to be&mdash;most admirably suited for
the purpose.</p>

<p>Smooth water&mdash;for it would take something like a tropical
cyclone to raise a sea at the head of the harbour&mdash;beautiful
surroundings, easy access to the shore, land available for good
playing fields. All these good things, as it were, going a-begging,
while the gales howled round the ship in her exposed
quarters at Portland.</p>

<p>And so, though she had been only eighteen months there, it
was decided that it should see the last of her in September, 1863.</p>

<p>On the 28th all was in readiness, and 108 cadets&mdash;about
half the full number&mdash;were sent on leave.</p>

<p>At 7.45 a.m. on the 29th the <i>Britannia</i> set out on
another little voyage. This time, however, there was more
towing power provided, the <i>Geyser</i>, an old paddle-wheel sloop,
taking the hawsers, with the <i>Prospero</i>, Admiralty tug, ahead
of her; and between them they pulled the old ship along at
quite a respectable speed. The sails were available if required,
but the <i>Britannia</i> was not destined again to spread
her wings, though she and her escort had to remain at sea, off
Dartmouth, for the night, entering the beautiful harbour at
nine o&rsquo;clock next morning, amid the enthusiastic cheers of
the inhabitants, and to the extreme satisfaction, no doubt, of
the cadets, as they realised the contrast of their future
surroundings with what they had left. As it turned out, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
day selected for the voyage was a lucky one, for that night
it blew a fresh gale outside, and the handling of so large
a vessel, in light trim, by the tugs would have been difficult,
probably involving the parting of hawsers.</p>

<p>The spot selected was about half a mile above the town,
and the ship was securely moored, head and stern, to four
heavy anchors, so as to be absolutely stationary, and quite
close to the western shore.</p>

<p>There was a busy time then for all hands: clearing away
rocks abreast the ship, making a beach for the cadets&rsquo; boats,
a landing place and cricket ground, with direct access up the
steep bank, so as to avoid the town, and so on. A great deal
of this work was done, more or less in the rough, by the ship&rsquo;s
company, under the boatswain, who, in huge sea-boots, superintended
the engineering of zig-zag paths and steps and
various other unaccustomed achievements. Tars take a
delight in a job like this, outside their ordinary duties, and
bring a remarkable amount of ingenuity and common sense
to bear upon it.</p>

<p>Their &rsquo;prentice work has, of course, been long since superseded
by that of contractors, the magnificent playing fields,
etc., being now approached by flights of concrete steps of
great solidity; pier, boatsheds, bathing place, etc., all in
keeping.</p>

<p>The number of cadets on board at this time was about
230; but this number proved insufficient to keep up the
supply of lieutenants required, so the entries were considerably
increased, with the result that the number, after
a few terms, reached 306, causing inconvenient crowding
on the sleeping decks and in the messroom, to say nothing
of the studies.</p>

<p>After many representations from Captain Powell, the
Admiralty in 1864 decided to supplement the <i>Britannia</i>
with another ship, and the <i>Hindostan</i>, an old two-decker,
was selected for the purpose, and sent round from Devonport.
She was one of several vessels built of Indian teak, a wood
which far surpasses British oak in durability and freedom
from rot; it is, in fact, practically everlasting.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
The new ship was moored ahead of the <i>Britannia</i>,
a bridge being constructed between the two, making them
practically one vessel, which proved to be of the greatest value.</p>

<p>There was not much history made during the next year
or two. There was, of course, a great deal done in improvement
of arrangements and organisation after the advent of
the <i>Hindostan</i>; and, as a proof that the extra accommodation
was needed, it may be mentioned that the number of
cadets entered in 1864 was 217, as compared with 122 and
183 of the years 1863 and 1862 respectively. This large
number was not maintained, however; for it fell to 159 in the
following year. The sudden and temporary augmentation of
entries was due, no doubt, to a state of alarm in which the
authorities found themselves as to the probable paucity of
lieutenants during the next few years.</p>

<p>In 1865 Captain Powell was succeeded by Captain George
Granville Randolph,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> an officer who enjoyed a great reputation
for strictness, and of whom his subordinates always
stood in awe. Though disposed to err, perhaps, on the side
of severity, Randolph was always perfectly fair and just,
and was a most capable officer. The frigate <i>Orlando</i>,
which he commanded in the Mediterranean before he went to
the <i>Britannia</i>, was a marvel of smartness, and some of the
performances of her crew in handling spars, sails, etc., still
remain as time-records for the very smart Mediterranean
Fleet of those days.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_5_5">[5]</a></span>
Now Admiral Sir George G. Randolph, K.C.B.</p>
</div>

<p>There is little doubt, however, that his appointment to the
<i>Britannia</i> fluttered the dovecots a little, and he soon made
his somewhat &ldquo;dour&rdquo; character felt. He was one of those
men who are not afraid to accept responsibility for their
actions, or to carry out any threat or promise to the bitter
end, even though it may involve the antagonism of the
whole of his subordinates.</p>

<p>On one occasion during his command the cadets took it
into their heads to protest against having the meat left from
the previous day served up as hashes, etc., for breakfast; and
as there was some little agitation among them, it was brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
to the captain&rsquo;s notice. The cadet captains were accordingly
mustered, and invited to state their grievance. The captain
heard them patiently, and then, to their delight, he replied,
&ldquo;You are quite right, boys, it shall be stopped.&rdquo; The boys,
thinking they had scored completely, chorused, &ldquo;Thank you,
sir!&rdquo; until the captain added grimly, &ldquo;But you will have
nothing in its place!&rdquo; As they knew perfectly well that he
would not swerve from his decision, they retired crestfallen,
and put up with the hashes, which probably did them no
harm.</p>

<p>Another incident had rather an unexpected result. On a
wet and cheerless holiday in the spring of 1867, going on
shore being out of the question, the boys were skylarking
about the decks, rather at a loose end, and some of the
bigger cadets began to amuse themselves by a form of
bullying, joining hands and rushing the smaller boys along
the deck with considerable violence, regardless of possible
serious injury from falls, etc. This amusement being carried
to rather cruel extremes, the officer of the day thought it
right to call the attention of the commander to it, who in
turn reported it to the captain. Possibly the captain may
have been aware of some previous cases of bullying, and
determined to make an example of the offenders; however
this may be, he resorted to drastic measures on the spot.
The cadets were called to divisions, and the culprits, four or
five in number, received then and there a good birching.
There is the authority of a naval instructor who was then in
the ship for the statement that bullying was very promptly
stopped by this proceeding; but apparently it was resented by
the friends of some of the cadets, an agitation in Parliament
was organised, and in July of that year Mr. Corry, the First
Lord of the Admiralty, was interrogated by Mr. Bass on the
subject. On July 25th the matter was dealt with in the
House as follows (reported in the <i>Times</i> of July 26th):&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bass asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether
he had made further inquiry respecting the mode of punishment
of cadets on board the <i>Britannia</i>. It was alleged from
a great many quarters that excessive cruelty was practised on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
board that ship; and it was stated by gentlemen acquainted
with the practice, and who had given their names, that
when a cadet was punished his legs and arms were tied
to ringbolts so that he could not move, and that he was
flogged with a birch broom which had been previously steeped
in water to make it more pliant; that fifteen cuts were
inflicted with it on the back, and that the doctors invariably
attended. He wished to know whether the First Lord had
made further inquiries on the matter, and if he retained the
opinion he formerly expressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corry said, in consequence of the statement of the
hon. member, he had thought it necessary to make minute
inquiry on the subject of the punishment on board the
<i>Britannia</i>, and the result was a complete denial that the
punishment of cadets was accompanied by the cruelty
described. Punishment was inflicted, not with a birch
broom, but precisely similar to that used at schools. There
was a complete denial of any such cruelty as had been
alleged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bass: The arms are not tied to ringbolts?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Corry: Certainly not. It is hardly necessary that I
should go further into the case, as the Admiralty, having
taken the whole subject into consideration, have thought it
desirable that the practice of punishing naval cadets should
be discontinued. (Cheers.) An order to that effect was
issued by the Board of Admiralty last Monday. (Cheers.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bass and his friends thus scored off the Admiralty
in a degree to which they were not intrinsically entitled.
The use of the birch, or other means of corporal punishment,
is a legitimate subject of controversy, upon which
many diverse opinions have always existed; but, granted
the advisability of its use, the allegations of Mr. Bass
are mere humanitarian padding. If you are going to inflict
corporal punishment upon anyone, man or boy, there is
certainly no cruelty in securing him so that he cannot
move; birch rods for the punishment of young seamen in
the Navy were most frequently made by splitting up an
ordinary birch broom into convenient small bundles for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
purpose; and the soaking in water had the effect of preventing
the ends flying off during the first few strokes;
while the attendance of the doctor is merely an obvious
precaution, in the event of a fainting fit, which may
possibly occur, even in the case of an apparently robust
subject. Needless to say, a delicate or weakly boy would not
be subjected to such punishment.</p>

<p>Mr. Bass, it will be
noticed, did not agitate for
the abolition of flogging.
Mr. Corry and his colleagues
must, however, be
credited with having investigated
the matter in an
independent spirit, and
with arriving at their decision
upon adequate
grounds; though the
general impression produced
must have been that
they were more or less
truckling to a piece of
unnecessary meddling.</p>

<p>Captain Randolph was
superseded in September,
1867, by Captain John
Corbett, after having held
the appointment for a period of only eighteen months.</p>

<p>Among other useful institutions introduced in this decade
should be mentioned the sailing cutters and the gymnasium.</p>

<p>To be capable of handling a boat under sail is, of course,
a very necessary qualification for a naval officer, and most
of it is done by midshipmen. The ordinary rig of a
Service cutter is what is known as a &ldquo;dipping lug,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> a lug
sail which has to be shifted to the other side of the mast
whenever the boat goes about; and as a cutter may be
required to use oars or sails at very short notice, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
undoubtedly the best adapted for the purpose. A smart boat&rsquo;s
crew will have the masts up and sail on the boat in a
very few minutes. It is, however, somewhat cumbrous to
work, and has no special value in regard to the general
principles which govern boat-sailing. In order, therefore, to
afford the cadets every opportunity of acquiring skill and
readiness at the helm, a number of small cutter-rigged vessels&mdash;a
ship&rsquo;s cutter <em>not</em> being &ldquo;cutter&rdquo; rigged&mdash;were provided
in 1867, with simple sails and fittings, so that three or four
cadets could, by permission, take one out on a free afternoon
and sail about the harbour, thereby gaining the practical
experience, combined with due responsibility, without which
neither boat-sailing nor any other art may be adequately
mastered. The cadets have to hoist the sails, seeing that
they are properly set, according to certain immutable laws;
to get the boat cleverly away from her moorings without
getting foul of anything, to run, beat, or reach, as occasion
may require; and finally to pick up the moorings again in
a seamanlike fashion, this last being certainly the crucial
test of the coxswain&rsquo;s ability.</p>

<p>These little vessels have answered their purpose admirably,
and are frequently in such request that there is quite a
struggle to get the use of one for the afternoon. Many of the
lads become very proficient boat-sailers, and an occasional
mishap is not severely visited, but taken advantage of to
explain what ought to have been done.</p>

<p>A properly fitted gymnasium is, of course, regarded as
a necessity at any modern school, and the <i>Britannia</i> has
been by no means behind the times in this respect, all the
various exercises being taught by an efficient instructor,
including fancy acrobatic displays such as the &ldquo;living
tower,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>The closing years of the &rsquo;sixties are marked by two
important innovations: the institution of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bon&acirc; fide</i> sea-going
training-ship for the cadets, and the introduction of
a competitive entry examination.</p>

<p>In February, 1868, the <i>Bristol</i>, a fine steam frigate,
recently paid off as commodore&rsquo;s ship on the coast of Africa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
was recommissioned as a sea-going training-ship for cadets,
in which they were to spend one year after leaving the
<i>Britannia</i>, the period of training in the latter being at this time
one year, making the maximum time of probation two years.</p>

<p>On August 3rd, 1869, however, a new circular was
issued by the Admiralty, in which the whole system was
reorganised,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the most important change being, as has been
stated, the adoption of competition in the entry examination.
Two other points are included in the preamble of the circular:
an increase of the time under training and a further reduction
of the number of cadets entered annually. Since the rush of
entries in 1864, already alluded to, the numbers had come
down from 217 to 121, the authorities being evidently afraid
of a superfluity of executive officers.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_6_6">[6]</a></span>
See <a href="#appendix_iii">Appendix III</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The necessity&mdash;real or imaginary&mdash;of reducing the number
of entries presumably caused some difficulty, owing to the
number of applications for nominations, so somebody hit
on the happy idea of giving many more nominations than
were needed, and making the examination a limited competition.
Any influential person who had received a nomination
for his son would then have the ground cut from
under his feet in case his boy&rsquo;s name never appeared on
the Navy List: &ldquo;You asked for a nomination for your son,
and we gave you one. What more could you want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, at any rate, appears to be the only possible reason
for giving 148 nominations during the year, of which it was
certain that only 74 could be effective, for it would be absurd
to contend that any benefit could accrue to the Service from
such a step.</p>

<p>The happy aspirant for the honour of serving his country
in the Navy had, practically, two examinations to pass, for a
preliminary test had to be successfully negotiated before he
was permitted to engage in a competition in which he might,
after hard grinding, come out thirty-eighth, and be compelled
to seek some other vocation in life.</p>

<p>It is difficult to refrain from dwelling at some length
on the anomaly of this method of obtaining suitable officers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
which, as will be seen, was abolished a few years afterwards,
only to be reintroduced later on. Suffice it to say, that it
has always been condemned by a number of officers whose
opinion should carry weight, as men who have devoted their
lives to the study of the efficiency of the Service, and how best
to ensure it; and if their opponents seek to convince them by
pointing to results, it is certainly within their right to
maintain that these might have been better without limited
competition.</p>

<p>The maximum limit of age on entry was reduced, as will
be noticed, from 14 to 13 years, leaving only one year&rsquo;s margin
between this and the minimum.</p>

<p>The whole scheme, in fact, tended to reduce the number
of entries, while a show of maintaining a larger number was
kept up by 50 per cent. of ineffective nominations.</p>

<p>In spite of the smaller numbers on board, and the prospective
further decrease foreshadowed by the new circular,
modern ideas as to accommodation, and a demand for more
studies, etc., caused the <i>Britannia</i> to be condemned as too
small for her office, and about July, 1869, the fifth <i>Britannia</i>
made her appearance at Dartmouth. She was laid down as a
sailing three-decker in 1848, but was subsequently lengthened
while still on the stocks, and eventually launched as a screw-ship
of 131 guns in 1860, under the name of the <i>Prince of Wales</i>,
assuming, however, the title of her predecessor. She was a
much larger vessel, and was fitted up in a manner suited to
modern requirements: only one mast was supplied, so that
she presents much more the aspect of a &ldquo;sheer hulk&rdquo; than
the old ship, in spite of a very handsome hull.</p>

<p>The average number of cadets entered each year during
the &rsquo;sixties was 153, though this does not include 1860 or
1861, of which there is no record available. The total for
these eight years is 1,223, who are accounted for, approximately,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Active List.</span></p>

<p class="center">Admirals, 18; captains, 107; commanders, 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>

<p>The number of cadets who passed out of the <i>Illustrious</i>
and <i>Britannia</i> from 1858 to 1861 was 559, which are
accounted for thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">READING OFF THE SEXTANT.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE decade included in the
&rsquo;seventies is somewhat bare of
incident as compared with its
predecessor.</p>

<p>The first event of importance was
the departure of the Rev. R.&nbsp;M. Inskip,
in 1871, after being connected with
the institution for over thirteen years.
The keen interest which this gentleman
took in his work has before
been referred to; and it is well illustrated
by a very elaborate diagram
which he prepared, and which, together
with some explanatory notes,
is now in the possession of his
brother, Captain G.&nbsp;H. Inskip, R.N.,
of Plymouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
Mr. Inskip, always intensely solicitous for the proper
advancement of his late pupils in the service, conceived the
idea of constructing a diagram from which, in conjunction
with an alphabetical list of the names of all the cadets
included in the period under consideration, it could be seen
at a glance what class any individual took when passing
out of the <i>Britannia</i>, and how he fared afterwards up to
the time of passing for sub-lieutenant, and in some cases
beyond this.</p>

<p>The heads under which this information is imparted are
as follows: Died; Left the service; Passed for sub-lieutenant
at the proper time; Lost time; Class obtained when passing
for sub-lieutenant; Promotion for passing well, and all distinctions
obtained, including the Royal Humane Society&rsquo;s medal,
the Beaufort Testimonial, etc.</p>

<p>This remarkable diagram, containing particulars concerning
all cadets who passed out of the training-ship from 1858
to 1871, is far too cumbrous to be reproduced in this volume;
but, in an explanatory paper printed in 1875, the author sets
forth the object he has in view, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Navy being the right arm of our national defence, it will be
satisfactory to those who take an interest in the welfare and efficiency
of the young officers who are in future to command our ships and fleets,
to be enabled to form some correct idea as to what extent the cadets
sent out from the training ship since her first establishment have
maintained the classification assigned them on leaving&mdash;that is, whether
on passing their examinations for sub-lieutenant they have or have not
kept the position they were considered to merit, as indicated by the
certificates originally awarded them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Inskip then proceeds to a minute analysis on these
lines, with regard to the cadets who passed out up to
December, 1868, and who would have been qualified by
age and servitude to pass for sub-lieutenant by June, 1874;
the total number under consideration being 1,606. Not
content with a general analysis, he institutes a comparison
between the first four in the first class, the first and last four
in the second class, and the last four in the third class, in
each year&rsquo;s examinations out of the <i>Britannia</i>; in other
words, the best, medium, and worst results of the training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
With his diagram&mdash;measuring nearly six feet in length&mdash;spread
out beside him, he embarks upon an elaborate and
convincing vindication of his beloved <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;for this is
what it amounts to&mdash;and there is no getting away from his
figures. Without reproducing the tables, which are rather
numerous and complex, it is interesting to note that the
following facts are clearly established:&mdash;</p>

From these and similar data Mr. Inskip draws the following
perfectly justifiable deductions:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Assuming that the ability of a midshipman to pass
his examinations for sub-lieutenant the moment his time is
served may be considered as evidence of proficiency, it is
seen that in this respect each class has maintained its relative
position with regard to original classification.</p>

<p>(2) That the comparison of selections with whole classes
shows that the original certificates were distributed on an
equitable scale, or strictly in accordance with merit.</p>

<p>(3) That this argument is confirmed by the general results
of the final examinations for sub-lieutenants.</p>

<p>In connection with this, he makes a very good point;
speaking of the seamanship examinations for sub-lieutenant,
he says: &ldquo;The certificates awarded may be taken as the
collective opinion of all the captains who have been actively
employed during the past eleven or twelve years, and we find
that of the midshipmen sent from the training ship with
first-class certificates, no fewer than 51&middot;2 per cent. have been
considered to merit first-class certificates; of the seconds,
28&middot;7 per cent.; and of the thirds, 17&middot;5 per cent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was rather a &ldquo;facer&rdquo; for the captains&mdash;and there
were not a few&mdash;who held that the <i>Britannia</i> training was
useless, or worse than useless, in regard to seamanship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The evidence given above,&rdquo; continues Mr. Inskip, &ldquo;abundantly
proves that each original class falls into its natural
place at the final examinations, from which fact we can only
infer that unless the original certificates had been awarded
with the utmost care, and a scrupulous regard to the individual
merits of each cadet, a coincidence so remarkable
could not have occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his final summing up Mr. Inskip says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Having now shown that the young officers have maintained
their original classification up to the time of passing
their final examinations for sub-lieutenant, we may allude to
the opinions entertained in some quarters respecting the
education of the cadets: it having been asserted that their
knowledge was of a superficial character, and that when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
first joined a sea-going ship they were deficient in many
branches of study relating to their profession. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
It was shown by examinations held in the Flying and
Detached Squadrons (some years ago) that the knowledge of
the midshipmen was inversely as the time elapsed since
leaving the training-ship, the seniors as a body standing at
the bottom. (Report of the Rev. J.&nbsp;B. Harbord, M.A.,
Inspector of Naval Schools.) This state of education at sea
may in some measure be accounted for by the fact that in
many ships no attempt had been made to keep up any
subject but navigation, the others not being given at the
final examination; it proves, however, that the younger
officers possessed the most information, and among these
were included all who had recently left the training ship; and
it also removes any just reason for asserting that they had
learnt but little while there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In such fashion does this champion wield his statistics in
defence of the institution which he had such a large share in
starting; and it must be admitted that anyone who wished to
refute his arguments would have a very tough task; though
he lays himself open to the reply, that a clever or industrious
cadet would in all probability turn out a clever and industrious
midshipman or sub-lieutenant. This, however, only
touches a portion of the case; his contention that the
training ship was satisfactorily fulfilling its object is fully
borne out.</p>

<p>It will be observed that this diagram, and the arguments
based on it, are completed and printed in 1875,
four years after Mr. Inskip retired; so he must have
employed his leisure time in compiling these statistics
after he had practically severed his connection with the
Service.</p>

<p>An officer who was first lieutenant of the <i>Britannia</i>
during the early seventies&mdash;Captain A.&nbsp;W. Warry&mdash;gives his
impressions of the ship at that time as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I joined on January 22nd, 1870. The boys had not
returned, and I had time to look round. The new ship had
not been long at Dartmouth&mdash;a year or so&mdash;and was certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
a great improvement on what the old Black Sea flagship
must have been. Captain John Corbett had, I understood,
been appointed to the command with a view of establishing
a milder rule than prevailed in Captain Randolph&rsquo;s time,
when I believe there was a good deal of corporal punishment.
There was none in Captain Corbett&rsquo;s time, nor has there,
I believe, been any since. There did not seem much for the
three lieutenants to do. We took alternate day duty, and on
these days heard and dealt with minor offences, or remanded
them for the commander next morning. We attended at
meals, looked round the seamanship classes, saw to the boys
going and returning from recreation, received any applications
and went the rounds, etc. As first lieutenant I had
a more special supervision of the seamanship classes and
periodical examinations. I also had the superintendence of
the games and recreations, and was entitled to draw on the
cadet fund for any requirements for them. Everybody who
has been in any way connected with the <i>Britannia</i> must
have felt the great inconvenience and waste of time in going
and returning from recreation; a lumbering old pinnace was
used; I trust some quicker mode of transit has since been
adopted. The air on the sleeping decks, when the boys were
turned in, was, I thought, far from being as pure as was
needful; nor did it appear to me that, situated as the ships
were in a narrow tidal river with high land on either side, the
general state of the atmosphere was sufficiently bracing. The
studies were as good as circumstances would admit,
but at best a ship is a noisy place, and the partitions
were far from sound-proof. A college on shore was constantly
spoken of, and it seems strange that upwards of
thirty years have elapsed since then, and this great need
is only yet under construction. The question of &ldquo;bounds&rdquo;
was always a source of trouble and constant punishment,
for any extension of a walk beyond these was an offence;
and Corporal McEwen had a disagreeable knack of turning
up at most inopportune moments from behind some hedge,
and pouncing on the youthful offenders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Previous to my time I heard that &ldquo;goose dinners&rdquo; (four to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
a goose) were provided at a farmhouse in the direction of
Dittisham, at 2s. 6d. per head. Beer, too, was provided, the
effect of which led to its discovery, and a more rigid
institution of bounds. The cadets could not land on the
Kingswear side unless with an officer in charge, so on Sunday
afternoons I frequently got a lot to join me in a walk,
which they liked. In this way I got into closer conversation,
and it is my pleasant recollection of the boys generally
that they were a delightful lot of little chaps, with whom
it was a pleasure to be brought into contact. Fighting
occasionally took place beside the rocks in the field above the
cricket ground. Permission was asked, and if granted the
fight was carried out in due form under the cadet captains.
I never heard of any bad result, though I am not sure that
it would not be better to try and avoid it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On January 24th, 1871, I took command of the
<i>Dapper</i>. Occasionally in the fine weather I took the senior
classes outside the harbour and cruised for the afternoon
under sail. Dinner was served as we steamed out, but any
motion outside caused sea-sickness, which interfered with the
interest in the work. More often the <i>Dapper</i> was employed
in going to Plymouth for stores, etc. Twice in my summer
we had a general picnic, to Slapton Lee and Salcombe
Harbour; both were very successful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During my time there was no bullying to speak of; the
boys were happy, and used to say they liked the <i>Britannia</i>
much better than their former schools; the food, they all
agreed was excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Dapper</i>, alluded to above, was one of the old 60-horse-power
gunboats, built during the war in China, 1857 to
1860; she was rigged as a barque for instructional purposes,
but apparently was not very freely used; and, indeed, a craft
of that size and build would be so exceedingly lively in the
slightest approach to a sea-way, that inexperienced lads would
not be able to &ldquo;lay out&rdquo; on her small spars with much
advantage, or without a certain amount of danger.</p>

however, a very fine frigate, and performed good service as a
sea-going training-ship, making voyages to the Cape, Madeira,
the Azores, etc., so that the youngsters saw &ldquo;blue water&rdquo; in
abundance, and even made old Neptune&rsquo;s acquaintance in
crossing the line. Those who served in her maintain that she
fulfilled her purpose admirably; and no one could doubt
that, after passing through the <i>Britannia</i> and spending the
best part of a year at sea in this manner, a lad of ordinary
capacity must be of considerable value as an officer in his first
regular man-of-war.</p>

<p>There was a very tragic incident during one of the
<i>Ariadne&rsquo;s</i> cruises early in 1872. She was bound for the
Mediterranean, and one morning, while under sail off Cape
Finisterre, the hands were turned up about 7 a.m. to reef
topsails, the wind rising rapidly with an ugly sea. A man fell
overboard from the main-topgallant yard, and the second
cutter, a ten-oared boat, was immediately manned, as is
customary under such circumstances, at the davits, and, in
spite of the heavy sea, was safely lowered and pulled for the
man, who had got hold of the lifebuoy. Sub-Lieutenants
Jukes and Talbot both sprang into the boat when she was
being manned, vying with each other in being first at the
post of danger. It was immediately decided to get up steam,
which, however, took three hours or more, and the cutter
being compelled for safety&rsquo;s sake to head the sea, while
the ship drifted to leeward, they were separated by about
four miles by the time the ship commenced to steam to
windward.</p>

<p>As she neared the boat the latter was turned round in
order to steer alongside, and was immediately caught on
the broadside by two heavy seas, the first of which filled her
with water, while the second capsized her, all the crew being
thrown out. Some got hold of oars, while others held on
to the boat.</p>

<p>The first cutter was immediately manned, Lieutenant
Bromley and Mr. Egerton, midshipman, jumping into her;
but ill-luck attended this attempt at a rescue, as the boat,
when being lowered, was lifted by a sea, and one tackle came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
unhooked, leaving her dangling by one end. All managed,
however, to get safely on board, except one seaman, who was
unfortunately drowned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, men slung over the side were doing their utmost
to get hold of the crew of the second cutter, and everything
handy that would float was thrown to them; the ship, however,
could not be kept up to the wind, and dropped once more
to leeward. Half an hour elapsed before she could regain her
position, and then it was quickly apparent that only a few of
the unfortunate crew of the cutter had been able to hold
on; two were clinging to the bottom of the boat and two or
three to the floating gear. The ship stopped close to windward
and gradually dropped down; the two men on the boat
managed to get safely on board; one man who had secured
himself to two oars floated close to the stern of the ship, and
Mr. Ellis, boatswain, made a gallant attempt to save him, going
overboard with a rope round him. He seized the poor
fellow&rsquo;s flannel singlet, the only garment he had on, but
the ship lifted away from them, dragging both out of the
water, the flannel, alas! giving way, and the huge hull of
the frigate, reeling back again and plunging downwards,
caught them both under the flat of the counter. The gallant
boatswain was dragged on board insensible, but the man he
had risked his life to save had disappeared.</p>

<p>The sad death-roll included the two sub-lieutenants and
eight men from the second cutter and one man from the
first cutter, both boats being lost.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis had been specially promoted to boatswain for his
coolness and courage when the ill-fated <i>Captain</i> went down,
he being one of the few who got on shore in the launch,
steering the boat with great skill in a heavy sea.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that at this period there were two sea-going
training ships for naval cadets, the <i>Trafalgar</i>&mdash;the
same vessel which escorted the <i>Britannia</i> on her voyage to
Portland in 1862&mdash;having been commissioned in August,
1870, by Captain Thomas B. Lethbridge for this purpose.
She did not, however, make such long voyages as the <i>Ariadne</i>,
and her headquarters were at Portland. This vessel was only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
kept going a short two years, for in June, 1872, she was paid
off, thus foreshadowing the subsequent disappearance of her
consort, a year later.</p>

<p>The <i>Ariadne</i>, of which Captain the Hon. W.&nbsp;C. Carpenter
was in command, with Commander Robert Woodward as his
senior executive, was abolished in 1873. On January
6th of that year a new Admiralty circular was promulgated,
containing some slight amendments in the regulations
with regard to naval cadets&mdash;among others, increasing the
maximum age on entry from 13 to 13&frac12; years&mdash;and a brief
clause cancelling the orders concerning a sea-going training-ship.
The <i>Ariadne</i> completed her cruise and was paid off in
the summer. It is not easy to account for this apparent
caprice on the part of the authorities; it was not until considerably
over twenty years afterwards that sail instruction
was finally abolished in the <i>Britannia</i>, and many rigged
vessels were in commission long after 1873.</p>

<p>There was a whisper at the time&mdash;to be accepted, perhaps,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum grano salis</i>&mdash;that a certain &ldquo;sea lord,&rdquo; whose son had
failed to negotiate his final examination as cadet, had formed
the opinion, on these somewhat slender premisses, that the
ship was &ldquo;no good,&rdquo; and that he was mainly instrumental
in bringing about the change. This may be a
fabrication, but, on the other hand, it may be perfectly true;
for it is quite certain that stranger things than this have
come to pass in the &ldquo;Navy trade,&rdquo; and at later dates than
the &rsquo;seventies.</p>

<p>Mr. Inskip was succeeded as Chief Naval Instructor by
Mr. Kempster Knapp, who, however, did not hold the post
very long, ill-health compelling him to resign in 1875, and the
appointment of his successor, in April of that year, caused no
small commotion among naval instructors in the <i>Britannia</i>
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>For some reason the Admiralty decided to go outside the
Service in seeking a suitable man, and the gentleman selected
for the post was the Rev. J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;P. Aldous, who had never
had anything to do with the Navy, and was a much younger
man than some of those over whom he was called upon to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
exercise a certain authority, and to whose advice and guidance
he had nevertheless to look in the discharge of his duties.
Whatever motive the authorities had for this unusual step, it
might very well have caused incalculable mischief; they must,
however, be accorded credit for considerable insight in their
selection, for Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson, one of those over whose heads
he was placed&mdash;the very man, in
fact, who might reasonably have expected
promotion to the post&mdash;writes
thus of him:&mdash;&ldquo;Fortunately, he was
a man of estimable character and
good sense, so that there was little
or no friction between him and the
naval instructors and others,&rdquo; which
is at once a generous appreciation and
a high meed of praise to Mr. Aldous.</p>

<p>Possibly the introduction of &ldquo;new
blood&rdquo; in the naval instructor&rsquo;s department
was the outcome of an
inquiry which was held in 1874. It
is not quite clear on whose representation
the Admiralty took this step, but an inquiry certainly
took place by a committee appointed by the Admiralty, and
composed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rear-Admiral E.&nbsp;B. Rice.<br />
Captain the Hon. W.&nbsp;C. Carpenter.<br />
Rev. H.&nbsp;A. Morgan, M.A.<br />
Captain Wm. Graham.<br />
Rev. Osborne Gordon, B.D.<br />
Geo. Busk, Esq., F.R.S., F.R.C.S.<br />
Jas. Vaughan, Esq., R.N.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Lords of the Admiralty addressed to each member of
the committee the following memorandum:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A question has arisen as to whether the conditions under which
naval cadets are trained on board H.M.S. <i>Britannia</i> are favourable to
their health and physical development. Their lordships are desirous
that this matter should be investigated by a committee, and your
attention is drawn to the following special points:&mdash;</p>

<p class="hang1">I. (<i>a</i>) The effect of confinement on board a stationary ship.<br />
(<i>b</i>) Ventilation.<br />
(<i>c</i>) Sleeping arrangements.<br />
(<i>d</i>) Diet.</p>

<p class="hang2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>II. (<i>a</i>) The course of study as regards the subjects, the number of
hours, and the routine.<br />
(<i>b</i>) The nature of the examinations, including that of entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under I., heads <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, the committee report most
favourably, and have no improvements to suggest, nor is this
at all surprising, since the number of entries had fallen from
131 in 1869 to an average of 62 in the five following years,
and there should certainly have been no difficulty in providing
adequate cubic space and ventilation in the two large vessels
for numbers not exceeding 100.</p>

<p>Under II., however, the committee have something to say.
They consider that the hours of study are by no means
excessive, but they recommend that the midday interval for
dinner, etc., be increased from fifty minutes to an hour
and a quarter at least in summer, as it is injurious to
proceed to study so soon after a full meal. They consider
that the brains of the cadets are overtaxed more by the
number of subjects than by the
length of hours, and recommend
the abolition of the following subjects
of examination: Grammar,
literature, history, Scripture history,
physical geography, physics, and
the introduction of Latin. A very
drastic measure, and, with the exception
of the introduction of Latin,
too utilitarian, perhaps, in its tendency
as compared with accepted
ideas in schools of that period.
A boy on joining the <i>Britannia</i>
after a year or so of special study
under a &ldquo;crammer&rdquo; to enable him
to pass the entry examination,
certainly could not be said to
have even approximately completed his education in
general subjects.</p>

</div>

<p>However, the committee had a still more important
recommendation in connection with examinations, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
held that the competitive examination on entry was &ldquo;hurtful
to the boys and injurious to the Service,&rdquo; and urged the
substitution of a qualifying examination forthwith.</p>

<p>Here they probably had the whole Service with them;
for, as has been pointed out, there could be no valid reason
for the introduction of competition in 1869, no one could
seriously maintain that the most suitable boys would be
thereby obtained for the Service, and only one witness has
much to say for it, having been partly instrumental in
introducing it.</p>

<p>Before going to Dartmouth the committee visited the
Royal Naval School at New Cross, the Greenwich Hospital
School, and Eton College, and they found the physique of the
cadets rather superior, age for age, to that of the boys in these
schools.</p>

<p>The head of the Naval Medical Department had evidently
been making strong representations about the <i>Britannia</i>, and
his evidence is rather that of a faddist who is determined
that nothing can be right about the ship or the place.
Certain figures on which he had partially based his objections
were found to be erroneous, and this was pointed out
to him, but he stuck manfully to his guns notwithstanding.</p>

<p>The committee found that the cadets excel in manly
sports, and more than hold their own in cricket against school
elevens of older boys.</p>

<p>Constant reference is made to the desirability of having
a college on shore, and most of the witnesses are in favour
of it, while a few, rather of the &ldquo;old sea-dog&rdquo; type, advocate
sending boys straight to sea without any previous training.</p>

<p>The recommendation of the committee is that the cadets
spend three years in the college, broken by two trips in a sea-going
training ship.</p>

<p>Their reason for recommending the introduction of Latin
is that by giving a few hours a week to it an intelligent boy,
reasonably well grounded on entry, would at the age of fifteen
be able to read C&aelig;sar, Horace, and Virgil without effort, and
that this would be a source of pleasure to him in after years;
but this appears to be a purely academic and unpractical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
view; it might apply to a boy here and there, but certainly
not to the generality, and some better reason is needed for
its introduction.</p>

<p>One of the recommendations of the committee has been
tardily adopted in the last year or so, viz. the institution of
a board by whom all candidates should be approved before
being permitted to undergo the examination; they think that
defects which are not discoverable by an educational test
might be patent to such a committee.</p>

</div>

<p>Captain Foley, who was appointed in August, 1871, appears
to have set about improving the
sanitary condition of the ship in
a very thorough fashion, and not
before it was needed. By clearing
out the ballast in some places,
and by a rearrangement of the
structure of the bilges, he had
arrived at a very satisfactory
result, which is highly approved
by the committee.</p>

<p>The seven or eight cadets who
are examined are practically
unanimous in their views.</p>

<p>They found they were
&ldquo;seedy&rdquo; after the strain of
grinding for the competitive
examination, and felt very tired every day while it was
going on.</p>

<p>They were not tired or seedy on board the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>They preferred a hammock to a bed.</p>

<p>They did not like the idea of a college on shore.</p>

<p>They found the food very good, and liked the ship much
better than their former schools.</p>

<p>One of them was asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to be put into a house on the top
of that hill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you would feel like a schoolboy?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you feel like an officer in her Majesty&rsquo;s service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question was put, no doubt, on account of the view,
expressed by two witnesses, that it was a bad thing to have
a training ship, as the boy&rsquo;s first acquaintance with a captain
would place him, to them, in the light of a schoolmaster; but
this is surely a fantastic idea, and one which no one who has
been through the <i>Britannia</i> would endorse. &ldquo;The captain&rdquo;
is always a distinct and novel personality to them, while the
naval instructor is as distinctly a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>The evidence of Admiral A.&nbsp;P. Ryder was very interesting.
He was well known in his time as a good mathematician, and
his views in regard to the examination papers were characteristic.
He did not see anything in them to frighten anybody,
especially as many of the questions which appeared difficult
for boys of this age were in reality based on what was learnt
in the text-books in use.</p>

<p>The most instructive part of his evidence, however, was in
connection with the establishment and maintenance of a
training ship or college. He was of opinion that the need of
a training institution of some kind arose in great measure
from the fact that, after the abolition of the college course in
1837, a very large percentage of young officers came to no
good, either voluntarily or involuntarily leaving the Service;
and he quotes some of Mr. Inskip&rsquo;s figures in support of the
view that a very great improvement has ensued in this
respect after the institution of the <i>Illustrious</i> and <i>Britannia</i>.
Furthermore, he related how, when he was private secretary
to the First Lord&mdash;the Duke of Somerset&mdash;in 1863, a letter
was addressed to every captain then serving, or who had been
serving within six months, asking for their opinions, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you in favour of a naval educational establishment, or should
boys go straight to sea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thirty-nine were in favour of it, and two against it;
thirteen did not reply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Shall it be on shore, or afloat?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
The captains were only asked for a reply to this in case
they had any decided view; twenty-four were in favour of
a college, and one only of a ship: the remainder did not
reply.</p>

<p>It will be realised from this that the fate of the <i>Britannia</i>
hung in the balance in 1863; and it is quite probable that
the Duke of Somerset counted on an adverse decision, or at
any rate on a majority upon which he could act.</p>

<p>Several witnesses alleged that the cadets, when they went
to sea, had to begin at the beginning, both in seamanship and
other subjects; and this, no doubt, is what Mr. Inskip alludes
to in his final remarks, above quoted.</p>

<p>There is abundance of contrary evidence, however, in
letters already quoted; and the captains and naval instructors
who had this experience must surely have been exceptionally
unfortunate in the youngsters sent to them.</p>

<p>Dr. Woolley, late Director of Naval Education, stated that
in 1868 the examinations on board the <i>Britannia</i>, which had
until then been conducted by the staff of the ship, were
undertaken by his department: a far more satisfactory
arrangement, one would imagine, for all concerned. Dr.
Woolley, while as reticent as the committee would permit
him to be, distinctly gave the impression that the examinations
failed in some degree as a true test, in consequence of
the examiners knowing too much about the capabilities of
individuals; and though he repeatedly disavowed any
implication of unfairness, he pointed out, with some show of
justice, that where the answers to a paper were below what
might have been expected of the individual, there was a
tendency to give him a lift if possible.</p>

<p>This contention, though plausible on the surface, is, however,
greatly discounted by Mr. Inskip&rsquo;s figures, already
quoted, which show that the cadets retained their relative
places in subsequent examinations with quite remarkable
regularity; and it is all to the credit of the instructors on
board the <i>Britannia</i> that, although called upon to conduct
an important examination of their own pupils, they should
have arrived at a result so obviously just. The papers were,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
it is true, distinguished only by numbers, the key to which
was held by the captain until the examination was over; but
this would, in the majority of instances, prove but a flimsy
disguise.</p>

<p>He also made the somewhat disturbing statement that
the discipline was not satisfactory, and that a considerable
number of cadets had misbehaved, or wilfully done badly in
the examinations, in order to obtain their discharge from the
Service.</p>

<p>The committee presented their report on October 6th,
1874, and in February of the following year a new circular
appeared, commendably brief as compared with the last one
of importance.</p>

<p>The whole machinery of competition is wiped out, and
a qualifying test substituted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The recommendations of the committee bear fruit in the
prominence accorded to Latin; but they did not stipulate for
the relegation of French to the background, which is rather
a surprising step, considering the relative importance of the
two languages to a naval officer, who may not unfrequently
find himself deputed to deliver complimentary messages to
the captain of a French ship. He may get safely through the
little sentence he has prepared, in which his captain or
admiral <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fait ses compliments</i>, etc.; but when the Frenchman
replies, with the politeness and volubility characteristic
of his nationality, the British officer is more often than not
at a loss.</p>

This being an undoubted fact&mdash;at least in those days&mdash;it
scarcely seems a wise policy to impress the young aspirant,
hard at work with his crammer, with the idea that he must
&ldquo;mug up&rdquo; his Latin, but may take geography instead of
French, which &ldquo;does not matter&rdquo;!</p>

<p>However, there were the orders, signed by the permanent
secretary, &ldquo;by command of their Lordships,&rdquo; and one can only
marvel who it is that engineers some of these curious circulars,
which, while usually inaugurating some beneficial innovations,
almost invariably contain others which any one who has any
accurate knowledge of the necessities of the case must
inevitably condemn.</p>

<p>The recommendation of a college on shore, although no
notice was taken of it, apparently, at the time, bore fruit later
on. A committee was appointed in 1876, composed of the
following gentlemen: Admiral George G. Wellesley, Captain
Charles T. Curme, Captain W.&nbsp;E. Gordon, Inspector-General
of Hospitals and Fleets Jas. Dornet, and Jno. Sutherland,
Esq., M.D., to ascertain the best site for a college.</p>

<p>In their report, dated November 30th, 1876, they state
that they have inspected possible sites at Milford Haven,
Hayling Island, Westward Ho, the Isle of Wight, Dartmouth,
Southampton Water, and Poole. At the last-named place
a choice of three sites was very generously offered by Sir
Ivor Guest, the one selected to be a free gift to the nation;
but the committee did not find that they were able to
recommend the situation.</p>

<p>Finally, they selected Dartmouth as the most suitable in
every respect, and Southampton Water <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">proxime accessit</i>.
Probably a very fine site might have been found there, and it
is a more bracing situation than Dartmouth; but the long
association of the <i>Britannia</i> with the latter perhaps turned
the scale in its favour.</p>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i> attracted a good deal of attention in
Parliament during the &rsquo;seventies. There is a Parliamentary
Paper called for in 1877, which gives a correspondence
between Mr. Penry Lloyd, whose son was in the <i>Britannia</i>
in 1876, the Admiralty, and the captain of the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
From this it appears that, on December 16th, 1876,
Captain Graham wrote to Mr. Lloyd, informing him that the
chief naval instructor reported that his son, Cadet J.&nbsp;E. Lloyd,
was idle and troublesome, had very little ability, was worthless,
and unfit to be an officer; and he requested Mr. Lloyd
therefore to remove his son from the ship.</p>

<p>This communication called forth an unexpected reply,
Mr. Lloyd declaring that he wished to withdraw his son, but
that he first demanded an inquiry into sundry charges preferred
by the latter against certain cadets, who, it was alleged,
had cruelly bullied him, and so hindered him thereby in his
studies that he was unable to pursue them to advantage.</p>

<p>One cadet, it was stated, compelled young Lloyd to sing
in the messroom, contrary to regulations, whereby he incurred
punishment; another kicked and knocked him down
without provocation; and on more than one occasion he
was compelled to give up his pocket money under threats
of personal violence. His fear of being beaten by the
cadets was greater than his fear of punishment by the
authorities, etc.</p>

<p>Captain Graham replies that he and his officers will
investigate the matter when the cadets return from leave.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, the Admiralty appointed a committee,
presided over by Admiral Willes, to inquire into the matter,
on board the <i>Britannia</i>, with the result that Mr. Lloyd was
informed that there was not sufficient ground for these
charges. He applied for the minutes of the inquiry, and was
refused; but the Admiralty upheld him in deprecating the
application of the term &ldquo;worthless&rdquo; to his son, in Captain
Graham&rsquo;s first letter.</p>

<p>There appears to be little doubt that there was some
bullying of a somewhat gross nature at this time; like all
other large schools, the <i>Britannia</i> has suffered from occasional
outbreaks of this kind, probably instigated as a rule
by one or two big boys; and as the small boys are afraid to
report it, there is often some difficulty in convicting the
culprits.</p>

<p>On June 18th, 1877, an attack was made by Mr. Shaw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
Lefevre in the House of Commons on the regulations of 1875,
when, as has been described, competition was abolished as
a result of the report of the committee.</p>

</div>

<p>This gentleman maintained that the substitution of a test
examination for competition was an unmixed evil; that a
far better class of boys was obtained under the latter system:
and quoted Lord Macaulay, who held that competition
automatically preserves a high standard.</p>

<p>Mr. Childers, supporting Mr. Shaw Lefevre, said that when
he became First Lord of the Admiralty (in 1869) his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
predecessor, Mr. Corry, urged him to reform the <i>Britannia</i>,
which he thought was in a bad state; and Mr. Childers
further states that, although competition was abolished on
the recommendation of the committee of 1874, ten of the
witnesses were in favour of competition, and only three against
it; which is certainly not borne out by the report.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Ward Hunt, the First Lord, in replying, admitted
that the test, as first laid down, was too easy, but it had since
been made rather more
stringent. He does not,
however, give any reason for
doing away with competition,
other than on the score
of injurious brain work; but
probably Admiral Sir A.
Cooper Key&rsquo;s remark when
before the Commission sums
up the matter pretty correctly;
he says that he disapproves
of competition for
boys so young, but, as the
number of applications exceeds
so greatly the number
of vacancies, he thinks it is
inevitable.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw Lefevre&rsquo;s
amendment was negatived
on a division, but only by 41 in a house of 301; showing
thereby that competition had a goodly number of
supporters.</p>

<p>In January, 1877, the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s two sons, Prince
Edward&mdash;then known as Prince Albert Victor&mdash;and Prince
George, joined the <i>Britannia</i>. They had special quarters
allotted to them, but in other respects they were &ldquo;in the
same boat&rdquo; with the remainder of the cadets, to whom they
were a source of much interest. The &ldquo;divinity that doth
hedge a king,&rdquo; or its equivalent in the case of a prince, is
considerably discounted among a lot of boys, and the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
Royal cadets often found themselves the target of endless
interrogations, resulting from the curiosity of their shipmates.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, how do you like being a Prince?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do
you do when you&rsquo;re at home?&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you ever get licked?&rdquo;
and so on.</p>

<p>Prince Edward, having recently recovered from a severe
illness, and not being really intended for the Navy, was left
to do pretty much as he pleased in the matter of study,
etc. He was sent to the
<i>Britannia</i> principally with
the object of benefiting by
the change and healthy outdoor
life.</p>

<p>Prince George, however,
went through all the work,
and the impression he produced
was that he was a
sharp lad, and, though very
backward on joining, turned
to with a will, and passed
out very creditably. He
used to tell the seamanship
instructors not to bother
about his brother, who was
not going to sea, but to devote
their attention to him.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1878
the Prince and Princess of Wales visited the <i>Britannia</i>, and
distributed the prizes.</p>

<p>During the last year or two of the &rsquo;seventies the
<i>Britannia</i> owed a good deal to Lieutenant (now Captain,
retired) Guy Mainwaring, who joined as first lieutenant in
1878.</p>

<p>It was at his suggestion that the custom was inaugurated of
having two photographs taken of each term, on leaving the ship:
one of the captains, and the other of the remainder of the term,
to be framed and kept on board as a record. This practice has
been continued ever since, and an interesting series of groups
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
has now accumulated, some of which are reproduced in this
book. In the pioneer group, taken at his instigation,
Lieutenant Mainwaring himself figures, seated on the gunwale
of one of the gigs, with the passing-out cadet captains round
him.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;JIM THE PIONEER&rsquo;S&rdquo; GRAVE.<br />

</div>

<p>A far more important institution, of which he was the
founder, is the pack of beagles. Being blessed with a good
deal of energy and of sporting instinct, Lieutenant Mainwaring
was the first to make any effort in this direction. It
is astonishing how keen naval men are on following beagles
when they get the chance.</p>

<p>The Gosport and Fareham Pack in bygone days&mdash;and, it
is to be hoped, at the present time&mdash;used to be followed by
quite a crowd of sailors; captains, commanders, lieutenants
and sub-lieutenants, to say nothing of athletic paymasters
and surgeons, all vying with each other for the front rank, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
all returning in the afternoon, caked with mud and exceedingly
cheerful, especially those happy ones who had succeeded in
&ldquo;pounding&rdquo; their dearest chums at a muddy ditch, or had
glanced back to see the said chums, not to be daunted, make
a futile jump into tenacious mud, and draw out their legs
with a sound as of cork extraction.</p>

</div>

<p>Lieutenant Mainwaring, deeming it a drawback that the
youngsters in the <i>Britannia</i> should be deprived of these joys,
proceeded to negotiate for the nucleus of a pack, and succeeded
in obtaining as a start two and a half couples of fourteen-inch
hounds, from the kennels of the late Mr. Thomas Cartlich,
of Woore, Staffordshire; these were supplemented by
the ship&rsquo;s terrier, &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; and they commenced in a humble
way by &ldquo;drag&rdquo; hunts, varied by badgers, when available, sent
by neighbours and friends from the numerous &ldquo;earths&rdquo;
in South Devonshire.</p>

<p>This began in the winter of 1878-9, and before long
another couple was presented by Admiral Stokes, who
hunted a pack of beagles in South Wales. Another addition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
was a hound bought from the Home for Lost Dogs, at
Battersea, and consequently named &ldquo;Homeless&rdquo;; and in
three years, with incidental additions and breeding, the
pack numbered twelve and a half couples, and was firmly
established as an asset of the ship, under the recognition of,
and eventually subsidised by, the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The kennels were at first by the racquet court, but this
was found to be a bad situation from a sanitary point of view,
and lacking sunshine, so they were subsequently transferred,
on a much more ambitious scale, to their present site on the
lower edge of the cricket ground; and there, as you pass,
you are greeted by the voices, at present, of some two and
twenty couples of lively little hounds, tumbling over one
another inside a wire enclosure.</p>

<p>They are under the especial care and patronage of the
commander, and it is an interesting fact, illustrative of the zeal
with which this unusual duty, for a sailor, is performed, that
when he was expecting a guest to dinner one summer evening
the commander did not arrive on board until the hour had
struck, having been detained by an &ldquo;interesting event&rdquo; at
the kennels, of which he felt himself bound to witness the
happy consummation!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; the pioneer of the pack, died in 1886, full of years
and honours, and was accorded a tombstone under the
shadow of the racquet courts;</p>

<p>The officers and cadets, to say nothing of the farmers and
others in the vicinity, have enjoyed many a good run since
those days, and an annual &ldquo;hunt breakfast&rdquo; has been
established. The landowners have been very generous in
affording every facility for sport, and at the hunt breakfast
they always declare that the privilege has never been
abused, which is in itself phenomenal as an admission on
the part of the landowners, and also a tribute to the sportsmanlike
spirit of the cadets. We may hear more about the
beagles later on.</p>

<p>The earliest book of regulations extant on board the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
<i>Britannia</i> was printed in 1873, but is brought up by
manuscript emendations to 1876.</p>

<p>It would obviously be too tedious to transcribe these
in detail, but some of the more interesting points may be
touched upon here, while the cadets&rsquo; routine, and other
matters without which this story could not be considered
complete, will be found in the <a href="#appendix_iv">Appendix</a>.</p>

<p>The regulations, which are the outcome of past experience
extending over nearly twenty years, cover every conceivable
point of discipline, instruction, recreation, leave of absence,
sickness, etc.</p>

<p>The officer of the day&mdash;one of the lieutenants&mdash;is the
person chiefly responsible to the captain for the due performance
of all routine duties and the maintenance of discipline,
except in the studies, which are under the chief naval
instructor, who reports direct to the captain any irregularities
in his department.</p>

<p>The officer of the day has, among other things, to turn out
at 5.30 a.m. and see that cadets under punishment are present&mdash;these
unlucky ones having to stand one hour between decks
before the usual time of turning out&mdash;also to receive reports,
investigate complaints, attend while the cadets are bathing,
from the shore, see that they do not land if the weather is bad,
and that they change their clothes if they come on board
wet. He has, furthermore, the responsibility of seeing that
only third and fourth term cadets use the sailing cutters,
that they do not go out in squally weather, and that they
are recalled if it turn out squally afterwards. In a landlocked
harbour such as Dartmouth very fierce squalls may come
down if the wind rises suddenly.</p>

<p>The cadet captains and chief captains have to assist their
superiors in maintaining discipline; as the difference in age
is not great, it has always been a somewhat difficult matter
to get them to do their duty, especially if it entails reporting
another cadet. One or two were asked, when giving evidence
before the committee in 1874, whether they had ever reported
a cadet, and the reply was always in the negative. Still, they
are useful in many ways, for mustering and so on, and some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
are found with that natural aptitude for command, which,
like the gift of poesy, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nascitur non fit</i>.</p>

<p>In 1876, however, and for a good many years afterwards,
the cadets&rsquo; corporals had so large a share in the discipline
that the captains did not come in very much. The cadets
before the committee were unanimous as to their dislike of
the corporals, though it must be acknowledged that they had
no very definite reasons to adduce. At this time a &ldquo;cadet
sergeant-major&rdquo; had taken the place of the master-at-arms,
probably with beneficial results, for a soldier is a more
&ldquo;understanding&rdquo; sort of man in such a position, and would
know how to assert his authority with tact and discretion.</p>

<p>The regulations for the cadets were such as would exist
in any schools, substituting seafaring words where necessary.
They received one shilling per week pocket-money&mdash;the
captains and chief captains two shillings and half-a-crown
respectively&mdash;and were not allowed to have in their possession
at one time a larger sum than ten shillings; nor were they
permitted to receive parcels containing eatables, or to bring
sweets, fruit, etc., on board when returning from leave.</p>

<p>Those who recollect the earlier days of the <i>Britannia</i>
will understand how this prohibition arose. Cadets were
allowed at that time to receive &ldquo;hampers&rdquo; from home, and
of course the lucky recipient felt bound to share the good
things with his friends. The offer was usually delicately couched
in the words, &ldquo;Bring your plate to my table at tea,&rdquo; and as
there were frequently a good many hampers, with a circle
of chums to each owner, there was a great deal of running
about the messroom at tea-time, also some jealousy and
searchings of heart. Some lads who were general favourites
might be seen visiting three or four tables, returning with
their plates heaped with a curious assortment of jam,
sardines, potted meat, cakes, etc., all elbowing each other in
one indigestible conglomeration&mdash;if, indeed, anything is not
digestible by a naval cadet. No doubt the confusion to
which this practice gave rise was the chief reason for its
suppression.</p>

<p>Bullying or annoying other cadets is laid down as one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
the most serious offences that can be committed, and subject
to the most severe punishment.</p>

<p>The heaviest punishment was reduction to the third
class for conduct. Cadets under this penalty wore a white
stripe on each arm and were obliged to conform to the
following rules:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get up at 6 a.m. in winter and 5 a.m. in summer, and half an hour
later fall in and drill until prayer time (8 o&rsquo;clock).</p>

<p>Stand apart from other cadets at all musters.</p>

<p>One and a quarter hour&rsquo;s drill every afternoon; leave stopped,
except one hour on shore under charge of a corporal.</p>

<p>Stand on the middle deck one hour after evening prayers.</p>

<p>Alternate days in cell, on bread and water; other days to take their
meals at cockpit mess table. Not allowed soup, beer, or second course.</p>

<p>To sit on a stool between decks when not in the cell, and kneel
apart at prayers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty hard programme for a boy, and could,
of course, only be prescribed by the captain, for six days
as a maximum.</p>

<p>Second class for conduct was of a similar nature, but with
considerable modifications. A white stripe had to be worn on
the left arm; no cell or bread-and-water diet was involved,
and a second-class table in the messroom took the place of
cockpit mess; the same restrictions as to soup, beer, and
second course. This could be imposed for from seven to
fourteen days.</p>

<p>There is a manuscript note in this book to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;When reduction to second or third class seems to be non-effective
with troublesome cadets, caning over the breech has been tried and
found most beneficial.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On a cadet being reduced to the second or third class, the
fact was reported to his parents or guardians.</p>

<p>Another captain&rsquo;s punishment was cockpit mess, which
was the same as third class, but no stripes were worn. One
day in cell on bread and water; dry bread for breakfast and
tea, and other restrictions of diet the same; limit, three days.</p>

<p>Then, again, there was No. 4, which involved six days&rsquo; extra
drill, leave stopped&mdash;except the penitential hour&rsquo;s march with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
a corporal&mdash;turn out one hour earlier, stand on deck one hour
after evening prayers, and one week&rsquo;s pocket-money stopped.</p>

<p>Finally, an offender was liable to be &ldquo;admonished by the
captain,&rdquo; which, though not an actual punishment, was duly
recorded, and that cadet would not interview the captain as
cheaply a second time.</p>

<p>The commander&rsquo;s punishments include: Copying the
regulation broken, turning out one hour sooner, extra drill,
standing on middle deck one hour after prayers, messing at
defaulters&rsquo; table (on reduced diet), confined to the cricket
field, stoppage of leave.</p>

<p>Serious offences were not very common, and during the
whole period since the training ship was first instituted there
has not been a single instance of anything like concerted
insubordinate action, such as may be found in the history of
a large number of schools.</p>

<p>The health regulations include, as might be expected,
vigorous measures against the introduction of contagious
diseases from outside, especially when the cadets are returning
from leave.</p>

<p>One precaution of a decidedly drastic nature is prescribed
in this book of 1876:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On the return of the cadets from leave the whole of their clothes
and bedding are disinfected; the cadets themselves are also marched by
terms into the bathroom of the <i>Britannia</i>, which for a time is made
into a sulphur room for disinfecting, and they remain in from five to
ten minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This clause is in manuscript, and does not appear in the
next edition of regulations, so it was presumably deemed to
be ill-advised; and no wonder. Imagine forty or fifty lads
crammed into the bathroom, coughing and choking with
sulphur fumes!</p>

<p>The officers who commanded the <i>Britannia</i> during the
&rsquo;seventies were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS period of our story commences with a considerable
reduction in the number of entries; and, as was the
case in 1870, this reduction coincides with the introduction
of competition, but with more rigorous conditions,
both with respect to the proportion of nominations to entries
and the nature of the examination.</p>

<p>The test examination had already been made more
stringent, as stated by Mr. Ward Hunt in the House of
Commons, the total number of marks being 1,200, and
French a compulsory subject, to the exclusion of geography;
indeed, the farce of minimising the importance of the former
did not long survive. The number of marks necessary for
passing had been augmented, six-tenths, or 720 in the aggregate,
being laid down as a minimum, which is a pretty
strict test.</p>

<p>However, it being considered necessary, apparently, to
reduce the entries, a new circular appeared, in January, 1881,
of which the principal conditions were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Appointments to naval cadetships to be made by limited competition,
except four annually to sons of gentlemen in the Colonies, and five
Service nominations, selected by the Admiralty from sons of officers of
the Army, Navy, and Royal Marines who have been killed in action,
lost at sea, killed on duty, or died within six months of injuries
received in action or on duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
These cadets will be admitted on passing the preliminary examination,
as detailed below.</p>

<p>Except in special circumstances, only <em>one-third</em> of those nominated
will be entered.</p>

<p>Limits of age on passing, 12 to 13&frac12;.</p>

<p>The preliminary examination will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Colonial and Service cadets must obtain 600 in the preliminary
examination.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not an excessively severe examination, especially
as the latter half of the first book of Euclid, and the
quadratic equations&mdash;at neither of which are boys of this
age usually strong&mdash;can be discarded; but to deliberately
nominate three times as many lads as are to be entered
appears inexcusable, not to say cruel.</p>

<p>However, much worse was in store, for in March, 1882, yet
another circular was promulgated, in which it was laid down
that the examination was to be held by the Civil Service
Commissioners; and in May, 1887, the ideas of these gentlemen
have apparently been adopted, and an examination of
absolutely ferocious severity is prescribed:&mdash;</p>

<p>This for boys of an average age, under thirteen! What
benefit to the Service was likely to result from such measures
it is not easy to perceive; and their unpractical nature was
evidently speedily realised, for two months later came fresh
regulations, altering the limits of age from 12&frac12; to 14, and
subsequently 13 to 14&frac12;, abolishing quadratic equations, the
latter half of the first book of Euclid, and exercises thereon,
and allowing a dictionary for French and Latin.</p>

<p>These regulations had, however, scarcely been in operation
for twelve months before another alteration was made&mdash;a
circular dated June, 1888, reintroducing the harder examination
of May, 1887.</p>

<p>There may have appeared to be some good cause at the
time for these extraordinary vicissitudes, but it is difficult to
trace them at the present day.</p>

<p>Naval education appears to have attracted a good deal of
attention in 1882, for several letters and a long article are to
be found in the <i>Times</i> on the subject.</p>

<i>Photo: Smale &amp; Son, Dartmouth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In January of that year a writer, over the signature of
&ldquo;E.&nbsp;E. Bowen,&rdquo; deprecates the early age at which boys are
subjected to competitive examination (then recently introduced
for the second time); and in April, &ldquo;Flag Officer&rdquo;
writes in reply to a suggestion from some quarter that cadets
should not be entered until the age of 16, and then go
straight to sea. After pointing out that they could not then
have sufficient time to qualify for lieutenant at 19, he goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
on to say that complaints are made of the inappropriateness of
the subjects taught in the <i>Britannia</i>. These, he says, should
include rigging, from the lower masts upward, stowage of
holds and magazines, laying out anchors, steam, a little
gunnery, and, as a matter of course, navigation, geography,
and drawing. This officer is evidently a &ldquo;Collegian&rdquo; of
the old days, under Inman, for he refers to what they learnt
in 1824 and 1825. In conclusion, he says, &ldquo;No, sir, let us
keep the education in our own hands; we know better than
any schoolmaster what we want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An article in the <i>Times</i> of August 12th, 1882, condemns
the whole system pretty severely; says that the subjects
taught in the <i>Britannia</i> are not properly learnt, and that
navigation is taught entirely by &ldquo;rule of thumb&rdquo; without
knowledge of the principles which govern it. The writer
quotes Professor Laughton in support of his views, as having
said, in a lecture at the Royal United Service Institution, that
any lad of 16 with an adequate knowledge of mathematics
would learn more navigation in a month than the &ldquo;poor little
fellows&rdquo; in the <i>Britannia</i> learn in two years.</p>

<p>Well, there are some men who are regarded as authorities
in these matters, quite in favour of &ldquo;rule-of-thumb&rdquo; navigation,
and gunnery also; and if a boy&mdash;or a man, either, for
that matter&mdash;can take and work his sights accurately, and
make a straight shot from a gun, it really is not of much
consequence whether or not he is well versed in spherical
trigonometry or ballistics. It is a fact, however, that cadets
in the <i>Britannia</i>, in the times of Captain Harris and Mr.
Inskip, did learn, in considerably less than two years, to work
a day&rsquo;s work, and the ordinary sights usually required in
navigation, with facility; and also got a pretty accurate idea
of the theory. They could, for instance, draw a diagram
illustrative of the working of a chronometer, a meridian altitude,
or an amplitude, show what sort of spherical triangle
was involved, and state the rule for its solution. If this could
not be done in the <i>Britannia</i> in 1882, there would appear to
have been a sad decadence.</p>

<p>Some light is cast upon the introduction of competition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
in 1881 by a naval instructor who was there at the time.
He says that an idea prevailed at the Admiralty that the
test examination did not supply boys who were capable of
successfully negotiating the exceptionally difficult papers set
for boys in the third and fourth terms. There were two
examiners who were noted for their hard and crochety papers,
and who, moreover, were known to have stated their intention
of cutting down the first classes; in which laudable
endeavour they succeeded to the extent of reducing the proportion
of &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; from 30 to 10 per cent., and were known
on board the ship by the nicknames of &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sword.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This reduction of first classes aroused alarm at the
Admiralty, and was, it is said, largely instrumental in procuring
the change from test examinations to competition.</p>

<p>In the <i>Times</i> of August 24th, 1887, there is a letter over
the signature &ldquo;Veritas,&rdquo; in which the writer compares the
cost per head per annum in the <i>Britannia</i> with that of the
Naval Engineer Training Schools at Portsmouth and Devonport.
An engineer student, according to this gentleman,
cost the Government about &pound;54 per annum, while a cadet
cost &pound;95; and, moreover, the engineer students, he contends,
were able to do useful work in the fitting shops, etc., and so
saved the Government something in this way. The expense
of the <i>Britannia</i> is, he says, incurred in teaching the cadets
&ldquo;knots and splices,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;now almost obsolete art of
seamanship.&rdquo; It is to be feared that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i>
which this writer assumes is scarcely justified by such an
assertion, as the following details of the curriculum on board
the <i>Britannia</i> at this time demonstrate pretty clearly:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="smcap">Subjects Taught.</p>

<p>Arithmetic.<br />
Euclid.<br />
Navigation and nautical astronomy.<br />
Spherical trigonometry (theoretical).<br />
Spherical trigonometry (practical).<br />
Charts.<br />
Steam.<br />
Drawing (model and freehand).<br />
Algebra.<br />
Plane trigonometry (theoretical).<br />
Plane trigonometry (practical).<br />

Seamanship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
Too many subjects, perhaps; but certainly not seamanship
to the exclusion of all else, as is clearly implied by
&ldquo;Veritas.&rdquo; Moreover, the art of seamanship&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of handling
a ship on all occasions to the best advantage&mdash;can never
become obsolete so long as there are ships afloat; it may
change its nature, and the consequent requirements of a good
seaman, who is still, however, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, the man who
can efficiently manage the ship or boat committed to his
charge.</p>

<p>There are some who should know better than &ldquo;Veritas&rdquo;&mdash;as,
for instance, Captain (now Admiral) Fitzgerald&mdash;who at
this very time complained that seamanship was too much
sacrificed in the <i>Britannia</i> to a multiplicity of other subjects.</p>

<p>However, it is time to drop this more or less academic
discussion, and see how the general story goes on in the
&rsquo;eighties.</p>

<p>One of the most important events was the establishment
of the <i>Britannia Magazine</i>, in February, 1884, and its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i>, together with the hopes and fears of the editor, are
clearly set forth in the opening article as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are going to have a magazine. Certainly! Every flourishing
body has its organ. We have opinions far too good to be limited to
sanctuary chairs, far too noble to be confined to the narrow limits of
the messroom. Why should we not bring them out to the world?</p>

<p>But first, who will read our magazine? The fellows! Yes, of
course, we expect every cadet to have a copy, even if it means one visit
less to a certain pink house. The officers? Yes, perhaps, if we do not
write about them. Some of the fellows at sea? Yes, we hope so, if
there is plenty about the games, boats, and beagles. Parents, brothers
and sisters? Yes, we should not wonder; but perhaps for that we
ought to put in every fellow&rsquo;s name as very much distinguished for
something, as the family will not care for the number in which
&ldquo;Bobbie&rsquo;s&rdquo; name does not appear.</p>

<p>And who are to be our writers? Why, ourselves, of course. We
want to write, and hope we shall not be considered too ambitious. But
if some of our officers will help us with one of the yarns they occasionally
spin, we shall be only too glad to print it. It will give an air of
respectability to our efforts.</p>

<p>At the same time, we would ask the kind indulgence of our
readers, our elder readers, and our officers. Boys will be boys, and we
hope our seniors will remember that we are only boys, and that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
magazine is written for boys. Though they may very likely think most
of it weak, still we ask them not to be too hard upon us, nor to run our
paper down too mercilessly:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Be to our faults a little blind.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>True, there are plenty of other papers, but we want one for
ourselves. And if our correspondents were not using their pens for us,
they would probably be cowering over a lantern reading a novel; or
their spirits, instead of leaking through their pens, might be after some
perilous skylarking. If they find our magazine too feeble altogether for
their taste, we would ask them to help us with an occasional article,
and so to raise our standard of literature, and help us to improve our
writing.</p>

<p class="caption">A BEAGLE MEET.<br />
<i>Photo: Smale &amp; Son, Dartmouth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Well, then, what will our paper be filled with? There will be
news, of course&mdash;plenty of it, and of the best kind. No murders and
horrors&mdash;that is not news&mdash;but reports of games, racket matches, runs
with the beagles, sports of all kinds; authentic reports, where the right
fellows win, not the people that the reporters choose to make win the
day after. What we want to know and remember is which watch is
the strongest, who plays the best hand at rackets, makes the biggest
score at cricket, and is in at the kill.</p>

<p>There is not a school in England that has such a variety of sports.
Why, we want a whole <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> to ourselves. We thank the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
newspapers very much for occasionally noticing our athletics and our
regattas. We want to see them in full. The news may be of merely
personal interest, but that is just what we want. This is <em>our</em> magazine!</p>

<p>But, of course, we must have some politics. Boys are hot
politicians. We don&rsquo;t care about long debates in Parliament, but we
can tell you who is right and who is wrong. We know that well enough.
Our line of politics may be described as strongly <em>loyal</em>; it is our duty,
of course, to support the Government of the time, because they support
us. But&mdash;well, murder will out&mdash;boys always were Conservatives.
They can&rsquo;t help it. They are made so. We know that you, at any
rate, Mr. Gladstone, will pardon us graciously when we say, as we
must, that the sooner the great Conservative reaction takes place the
better we shall be pleased.</p>

<p>In such fashion is the <i>Britannia Magazine</i> introduced to its
public. The editorial arrangements are probably unique, the
commander, and subsequently one of the lieutenants, being
editor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i>. Sometimes an individual of a literary turn
of mind would join the ship, and take it on for the pure joy
of scribbling; but this only made the difficulty of obtaining
volunteers more apparent when he left. It was, in fact, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
old story: everybody likes to read a light and amusing
periodical, but few care about assisting to run it, unless, of
course, there are emoluments attached to the office; so the
purely honorary editor had the onus of selecting the most
suitable compositions presented for each number; and sometimes,
like Oliver Twist, he had to ask for more; while of him
was expected an able and well-written summary of news, etc.,
every time.</p>

<p>On some occasions he was compelled to have recourse to
the time-honoured subterfuge of devoting considerable space
to a wail over the dearth of material; a process which does
not bear repeating too frequently. Some people always commence
their letters in this fashion, and get comfortably over
the first page before they start, as it were.</p>

<p>One always looks with some suspicion&mdash;such is the
frailty of editorial and other samples of human nature!&mdash;on
an item headed &ldquo;a positive fact&rdquo;; or, still worse, with an
asterisk, and &ldquo;fact&rdquo; tersely inserted as a footnote.</p>

<p>The following appears with these credentials in the
<i>Britannia Magazine</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two countrymen were heard discussing a cadet who was swaggering
in his brand-new uniform: &ldquo;What is he, Bill?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s the new telegraph boy!&rdquo; (Exit cadet.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This may be capped by another story&mdash;of equally unimpeachable
veracity, of course&mdash;of a cadet who, many years
ago, was making a journey in his uniform. A discussion arose
between two of his fellow-passengers on some more or less
technical point concerning railways; and, to the young hero&rsquo;s
surprise, it was referred to him. His audience appeared to
be both surprised and grieved at his professed ignorance on
the subject, and ventured a remonstrance: &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re one
of &rsquo;em, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; (No exit available.)</p>

<p>Whether a naval cadet would prefer being taken for
a telegraph boy or a railway porter is an interesting question,
which might with advantage be propounded in the magazine.</p>

<p>One of the earliest contributors was a &ldquo;new,&rdquo; who
describes his first night on board, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I came on board about 7 p.m., in a small steam pinnace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
with thirty-two others, on the 25th January, 1884. The first thing to
be done was to get ready for mess. After falling down a hatchway,
and jamming my fingers in the lid of my chest, I went down to the
messroom, but not before I had somehow got muddled and gone into
an officer&rsquo;s cabin, as I thought (I found out afterwards that it was the
barber&rsquo;s shop), out of which I retreated, not daring to look whether its
occupant was there, expecting in all probability the nearest movable
object hurled at my head. After mess there was not much to do except
pace the deck and ask fellows their names (which was not unfrequently
answered by &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;). When the bugle sounded we had to
turn in; but I found that getting into a hammock for the first time is
not one of the easiest things, and after several vague attempts, which
generally ended in getting in at one side and out at the other, I was at
last helped in by my servant; and when once in, dare not move in case
I should be capsized. After we had turned in about a quarter of an
hour the next fellow to me began to swing most violently, which swung
me also, and in the fray my pillow fell down; and I decided that it was
safer to do without, as I was told that I should not get helped in again.
Shortly after this I fell asleep; and as this little history is only about
my first night, I must end at sleep.</p>

<p>It is sad to be compelled to say that this pseudonym
cannot be accepted as genuine. Observe, that the writer
represents himself as arriving on January 25th, so that in
February, when the first number was published, he would, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
the parlance of former days, have been a &ldquo;cheeky new
fellow,&rdquo; and it is extremely improbable that any cadet in that
humble position would venture upon so bold a step as a
contribution to the magazine. And as to &ldquo;pacing the deck
and asking fellows their names&rdquo;; shade of Marryat! What
would happen to a &ldquo;new&rdquo; who so presumed?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the writer&rsquo;s familiarity with steam pinnaces
and hatchways is not altogether compatible with &ldquo;newdom.&rdquo;
No doubt he enclosed his card to the editor, &ldquo;not necessarily
for publication, but as a guarantee of good faith&rdquo;; but we are
all well aware of the heroic inviolability of editors under these
circumstances, and a team of wild horses would probably
prove quite futile.</p>

<p>The following is a specimen of the style of advertisement
inserted for the special delectation and advantage of &ldquo;news&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stodge! Stodgers!! Stodged!!! In the magnificent and capacious
shop kept by Cadet Corporal Baker, amongst a large and miscellaneous
assortment of sweets, the following will be found delicious:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yellow and pink snakes, warranted to last the most experienced
sucker half an hour, and to give him an awful stomach-ache, all of which
enjoyment can be obtained for the ridiculously small sum of one
halfpenny!</p>

<p>Manila cigars.&mdash;These will be found extremely mild, and there is
not the slightest danger of the most utter novice in the noble art of
smoking being turned up; and there is also the subtle delight of
greening the cadet corporals that you are smoking. The cost is one-eighth
of a penny, but they are retailed at a halfpenny.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The grammar of the last &ldquo;par&rdquo; cannot be commended;
the writer is weak in the matter of conjunctions. But one
must not be hypercritical over advertisements.</p>

<p>In May, 1884, the <i>Wave</i>, a small barque-rigged vessel of
about 300 tons, and 250 horse-power, arrived to take the
place of the ancient <i>Dapper</i>, before alluded to. She was not
much larger than her predecessor, but had considerably more
steaming power, and was of finer dimensions. She was afterwards
relegated to steam instruction only, but when first
instituted was designed for instruction in working yards,
masts, and sails, tacking and wearing ship, steering, use of
log and lead, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
&ldquo;The poor old <i>Dapper</i>,&rdquo; says the <i>Britannia Magazine</i> of
this date, &ldquo;looks very sad in winter garb alongside her new
sister, who has taken all the life from her, and we suppose
her funeral is not far off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is another paragraph concerning the arrival of the
<i>Wave</i>, which hints, in the most delicate and refined manner,
at certain possibilities:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Wave</i> has really started at last, and now we shall all
have to order basins, or else have her commander foul of us
when we are at sea, and the ship&rsquo;s side is nicely polished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This foreshadowing was, as we shall see, only too literally
fulfilled.</p>

<p>The magazine was frequently made the publishing medium
of verses, the authorship of which is usually religiously
veiled; youthful poets are proverbially shy, and prefer to
blush unseen. The following is the pioneer poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<p>The moral&mdash;that the midshipman of the preceding watch
should turn in without being duly relieved&mdash;is questionable;
but the hypothetical conditions under which he is ultimately
recommended to adopt this course are certainly exceptional.
No one could, with any show of justice, accuse him of having
failed to make use of every legitimate device to rouse his
relief!</p>

<p>Contributions were invited, as has been hinted in the
editorial preface, from fellows who have gone to sea; and one
of these avails himself of the opportunity to draw a comparison
between his reception on board his first sea-going ship
and that usually accorded to a fresh arrival on board the
<i>Britannia</i>; considerably to the detriment of the latter.</p>

<p>He presented himself, in fear and trembling, on a cold
and wet evening, to the officer of the watch, who received
him with great courtesy: &ldquo;Oh, you must be Jones? Come
and report yourself to the first lieutenant. What a beastly
night for you to join!&rdquo; &ldquo;No. 1&rdquo; greets him with, &ldquo;You poor
little chap, you must be frozen!&rdquo; calls a senior of the gunroom,
and gives strict injunctions that Jones is to be made as
happy as possible immediately; and the officer of the watch
invites him to share his &ldquo;watch&rdquo; dinner at eight o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Jones, pondering over these things, makes some resolutions
concerning his future conduct towards his juniors; which, let
us hope, he did not fail to carry out.</p>

<p>The prosperity and popularity of the beagles in November,
1884, may be inferred from the fact that on one occasion
there were no fewer than thirty-four mounted followers,
including seven or eight officers of the ship; and a great
following on foot besides. Of course, by this time &ldquo;drags&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
and badgers had long been abandoned, and the swift and
legitimate hare was always the object of pursuit. There
usually appeared to be little difficulty in starting one, and not
a few instances have occurred of the hounds getting on
a fresh scent crossing the original one.</p>

<p>November is a good month for beagles; but scarcely as
well suited for a trip in the <i>Wave</i>. This diversion was, however,
arranged on November 8th, 1884, this being a holiday
in honour of the Prince of Wales&rsquo; birthday.</p>

<p>The excursion was to Plymouth, and a good number of
light-hearted youngsters put down their names for it, recking
little of the vagaries of Channel weather at this season.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most appropriate and heartfelt description
of the cruise is contained in a poem (a long way after
Longfellow), which appeared subsequently in the magazine:&mdash;</p>

<p>The writer, it will be noticed, has adhered very closely to
the pattern he selected, quoting one verse in its entirety, and
displaying a certain recklessness in respect of the number of
feet in a line which is so characteristic of Longfellow.</p>

<p>There were many other cruises, both winter and summer,
in the <i>Wave</i> after this, and apparently the weather was more
propitious, for we do not hear any more sad wailings about it;
though one of the party, on this first occasion, was heard to
declare that if he were twenty years in the ship he would not
again be caught going for a &ldquo;pleasure trip&rdquo; such as this in
the winter months.</p>

<p>The magazine was not confined to descriptions of this
kind, or laudatory articles and accounts of successful sports,
etc.&mdash;of which more anon&mdash;but warnings, editorial and otherwise,
on various points of conduct and etiquette are not
infrequent.</p>

<p>A letter, signed &ldquo;A Cadet,&rdquo; enlarges on the undesirability
of certain prevalent pranks when travelling by rail:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the cadets continue to play the fool with the porters, shoot off
catapults and squibs at travellers, etc., they will be getting all leave
stopped, or a corporal in attendance; or the railway company will
refuse to stop the trains at the level, and they will have to walk round
from Kingswear Station.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last allusion is to the accommodation of having
certain trains stopped opposite the ship for the convenience
of officers and cadets. Those who are not acquainted with
the locality may not be aware that the railway does not run
into Dartmouth, Kingswear, on the opposite side of the
harbour, being the terminus.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there is a letter in the same number
from an outsider on precisely the same subject over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
signature &ldquo;Old Meddler,&rdquo; who is evidently a somewhat
irascible old gentleman residing in Torquay. He concludes
his letter as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether corporal punishment has been abolished on
board the <i>Britannia</i>; probably, like many good things, it has. But I
carry a good stout cane myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This ferocious old boy would, however, have first to &ldquo;catch
his cadet&rdquo;!</p>

<p>The editor takes occasion to remark that &ldquo;Old Meddler&rsquo;s&rdquo;
letter would not have been inserted but for the corroborative
remarks of &ldquo;A Cadet.&rdquo; Whether or not the double warning
was productive of beneficial results is not stated. Probably,
as long as the world lasts, boys and young men will continue
to exercise their ingenuity in this fashion, to their own gratification
and the discomfort of their fellow creatures. It is
their nature to!</p>

<p>A number of the cadets had been through a course of &ldquo;first-aid&rdquo;
instruction, under the St. John Ambulance Association,
and here is an account of the result:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A fellow broke his arm up in the field the other day, and the
medical staff turned it to splendid account and lectured to a crowded
audience over the prostrate body of the wounded cadet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, what do you call this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broken arm, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know it is broken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we waggled it about, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple or compound fracture?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he did it so easily, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came out a volley of all the stored up information acquired
at the late classes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stick a mustard plaster on the back of his neck, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put him in a hot bath, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk him up and down as fast as you can, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold him up by the heels, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie him to a broom-handle, two billiard cues, and a rifle, sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tickle his nose with a feather, sir!&rdquo; and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prostrate hero must have had lively anticipations
during this exchange of ideas!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
We are not informed what course would be adopted by a
&ldquo;first-aid&rdquo; cadet under certain alarming conditions which
apparently might arise when out &ldquo;mushrooming,&rdquo; though it
is recorded in the magazine that the process by which a
cadet distinguishes a mushroom from a toadstool is to eat it.
If he dies, it is a toadstool; if he lives, it is a mushroom!</p>

<p>Towards the end of the &rsquo;eighties the electric light was
installed on board both ships, and the only marvel is that
it was not done earlier. Those
who have experienced the endless
worry of lamps and candles
on board ship will understand
what a boon the electric light is.</p>

<p>The dynamo was first placed
on board the <i>Hindostan</i>; but a
wooden vessel is one huge conductor
of sound and vibration,
and before long it was shifted
to a small vessel specially provided,
and moored just above
the ships. This was, in fact, one
of the old mortar vessels constructed
for use in the Baltic
during the Crimean War.</p>

<p>No one who has thus far
perused these pages will be surprised to learn that the
&rsquo;eighties did not pass without a committee being specially
appointed to consider the vexed question of naval education.
There has always existed, as we have seen, a sort of
chronic dissatisfaction with the existing condition of affairs;
and this again reached a climax in 1885.</p>

<p>On March 26th in that year the Admiralty appointed a
committee, constituted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vice-Admiral W.&nbsp;G. Luard; Commander the Right Hon. the Earl
of Dalhousie; W.&nbsp;D. Niven, Esq., Director of Studies at the Royal
Naval College; Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Wilson, Head Master of Clifton College;
Rev. W. Rogers, Rector of St. Botolph; and Captain Charles Johnstone.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Points to be Considered.</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Limits of age and subjects of examination for the entry of
cadets.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Course of study and instructional arrangements on board the
<i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> concern later examinations not connected with the
<i>Britannia</i>.)</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) To consider and offer opinions or suggestions for the improvement
of the education of naval executive officers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In their report the committee point out what they consider
to be defects in the present system:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(1) The failure to get the best material in the country. The
material is good, but it is not the best that could be had; and we feel
convinced that the special preparation of boys before coming to the
<i>Britannia</i> does not tend to improve that material.</p>

<p>(2) The attempt to teach in the <i>Britannia</i> what cannot be properly
learnt at the age of the cadets on board; the result being that the
knowledge is mechanical, and that the principles are unintelligently
acquired and soon forgotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They also fall foul of the seamanship instruction, and
consider the <i>Wave</i> of very little use, as she is not well adapted
for drills, and cannot conveniently go out for more than a
day at a time.</p>

<p>They recommend that a ship-rigged corvette should be
substituted, to be moored abreast the present ships, with a
bridge across, so that her upper deck would be available as a
playground during short intervals when the cadets cannot
land.</p>

<p>Under the head of Suggestions, they are bold enough to
advocate the abolition of nominations, which they think place
artificial difficulties in the way of getting into the Navy; and
they suggest that the first test should be the lower certificate
of the Oxford and Cambridge Local boards, at about the age
of 15, with a further examination at 16 by the Civil Service
Commissioners, after which the cadet should have one year&rsquo;s
training in practical navigation and seamanship, in a stationary
ship or a college. And they consider the Solent a more
suitable place for a training-ship than Dartmouth, as the
harbour at the latter place would be inconvenient, if not
dangerous, for sailing brigs, which they consider necessary.</p>

Well, the result of all this inquiry and suggestion appears
to be, so far as the <i>Britannia</i> is concerned, almost nil.</p>

<p>Admiralty nomination continues to be the necessary
initial step for entry: there are no Oxford and Cambridge
Local certificates required, the <i>Wave</i> is retained, no brigs are
attached, nor is a ship-rigged corvette moored alongside with
a bridge across; finally, the <i>Britannia</i> remains at Dartmouth.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;recommendation&rdquo;&mdash;apart from &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo;&mdash;is that
nominations should be given at
any age after 11 (this with the
view of previous preparation);
and yet one of the defects said
to exist in the present system is
special preparation before coming
to the <i>Britannia</i>!</p>

<p>It is a fact that recommendations
of specially appointed committees
are very rarely acted upon
to any great extent; they are frequently
very unpractical, or they
involve extra expenditure, to
which the Admiralty demur.</p>

<p>The suggestion of the Solent
as a more suitable locality than
Dartmouth appears to require a
good deal of explanation; the
committee, in the same breath almost, deprecates the want
of a spacious deck for the boys to run about on during short
intervals of recreation, when they <em>cannot land</em>. There would
be plenty of long intervals in the Solent without landing!</p>

<p>It is obvious that if a stationary ship, instead of a college,
is used, she must be so placed that easy communication with
the shore is never interrupted by weather.</p>

<p>And then the brigs. Why <em>brigs</em>? Why not a steam
vessel, larger and more commodious than the <i>Wave</i>, and fully
rigged? She would be able to sail in and out of Dartmouth
sometimes, when there happened to be a &ldquo;soldier&rsquo;s wind&rdquo;&mdash;by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
no means unfrequent there&mdash;and at other times there is
the screw to fall back upon.</p>

<p>The suggested substitute for nominations also strikes one
as impractical in the extreme. Where are the boys to go
after they have intimated their desire to enter the Navy, and
have produced an Oxford and Cambridge Local certificate?
There must be a list of such candidates at the Admiralty, and
they would be scattered all over the kingdom at various
schools when notice would have to be given of the examination
by the Civil Service Commissioners.</p>

<p>On the whole, one gets somewhat weary of committees;
and very weary work indeed is the reading of the thousands
of questions and answers so scrupulously recorded in the
Blue Book.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <i>Britannia</i> got on pretty well in the
&rsquo;eighties, and turned out the usual proportion of efficient
executive officers. Out of 763 who presented themselves for
the passing out examination, 36, or 4&middot;7 per cent., failed; which,
considering that the <i>Britannia</i> is admittedly a probationary
establishment, and that it was being constantly alleged at
this time that the cadets could not learn their work properly,
is a very small proportion of failures.</p>

<p>The officers who commanded the <i>Britannia</i> during the
&rsquo;eighties were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Captain R. Wells, appointed August 31st, 1880.<br />
Captain N. Bowden-Smith, appointed September 20th, 1883.<br />
Captain F.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;D. Bedford, appointed August 16th, 1886.<br />
Captain Noel S.&nbsp;F. Digby, appointed September 7th, 1889.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The total number of entries during this period was 883, of
whom the Navy List gives the following record:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Active List.</span></p>

<p class="center">Captains, 5; commanders, 132; lieutenants, 431.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Retired List.</span></p>

<p class="center">Lieutenants, 21.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A total of 589, leaving a balance of 294, or 33 per cent., to be
accounted for as dead or removed from the Navy List.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
One of the cadets of the &rsquo;eighties&mdash;the Hon. Horace L.&nbsp;A.
Hood&mdash;has gone up the ladder in remarkably quick time. He
entered July 15th, 1883, and in the examinations for sub-lieutenants
he was awarded a first class in every subject,
obtaining an aggregate of 4,398 marks out of a possible 4,600;
for this he was immediately promoted to lieutenant, April 2nd,
1890. He served in a gunboat on the Nile during Lord
Kitchener&rsquo;s operations in 1898, and for his services there was
promoted to commander November 15th, 1898, finally
obtaining captain&rsquo;s rank January 1st, 1903, in less than 20
years from entry as cadet, at the early age of about three-and-thirty.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE &rsquo;nineties were still very young when Captain Digby&mdash;who,
as has been stated, was appointed in 1889&mdash;found
himself confronted by a disciplinary problem
somewhat difficult of solution.</p>

<p>Captain Digby would be considered by those who knew
him to be an ideal commander for an institution like the
<i>Britannia</i>. Of a most agreeable personality, combining
great kindliness with the capacity for a due amount of
severity if needed, he appeared to be cut out for the work;
and yet it was his lot to bring to light a rascally sort
of bullying which had, as he himself admits, been going on
for a long time, and to be made the object of repeated attacks
in the columns of the <i>Times</i>; for there was a very lively
correspondence, to say nothing of leading articles, on the
subject, and all sorts of people had their shot at the training-ship,
some of whom did not very well understand what they
were talking about.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> opens the ball with a leader on September 30th,
1891, in which it is roundly asserted that such doings are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
only possible in the <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;a crude sort of statement,
and only permissible after a very thorough investigation.
&ldquo;Wykehamist,&rdquo; eager to disparage the <i>Britannia</i> as compared
with public schools, joins in the same strain, though goodness
knows there have been gruesome tales told of these from
time to time. He says, with some truth, that the difference
in age between the cadet captains and the other boys is too
slight, and that supervision by superiors is the only safeguard.
The cadet corporals were still in existence at this time, and it
is quite easy to conceive that if these were lax some evil-disposed
cadets might initiate bullying and other practices of
a worse nature without much chance of their reaching the
captain&rsquo;s ears, at any rate for a considerable time.</p>

<p>The principal indictment was to the effect that the elder
cadets &ldquo;fagged&rdquo; the younger for money, that this was
constantly extorted by means of menaces and cruel treatment;
and there is no doubt that it was true, though probably not
practised to the extent which was alleged by some.</p>

<p>&ldquo;E.&rdquo; says that where bullying exists it is entirely the
captain&rsquo;s fault. Let a suitable captain be appointed, and
remain as long as his services are not required elsewhere,
and let him select his own junior officers.</p>

<p>This is all very well, but there are many who hold the view
that it is not desirable to keep one man too long in command,
and certainly there are not wanting instances where, in similar
institutions, a long period under one command has resulted
in &ldquo;grooviness&rdquo; and a sort of fool&rsquo;s paradise, to be rudely
exposed by an energetic successor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;M.&rdquo;&mdash;an old <i>Britannia</i> boy&mdash;says that in his
time a cadet was dismissed for &ldquo;fagging&rdquo; a junior to steal
a letter containing a money order; this, however, cannot
but be regarded as a flagrant instance of individual depravity
such as may be encountered in any school. If the initials
of the writer are genuine, his time in the training-ship
goes back a long way, somewhere in the &rsquo;sixties. He appears
to hold a poor opinion of the cadets of those days, and says
the captains were as bad as the rest.</p>

<p>On October 14th Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
&ldquo;Through the Mill&rdquo; come to the rescue, and stoutly
defend the <i>Britannia</i>, pointing out that, judging from the
officers eventually turned out, the ship cannot be a sink of
iniquity such as is represented, and that bullying will always
go on to a certain extent among a number of boys.</p>

<p>On the 17th the editor of the <i>Western Morning News</i>,
who appears to be particularly anxious to show up the
<i>Britannia</i> in an unfavourable light, replies that &ldquo;Through
the Mill&rdquo; takes much too rosy a view of the matter, and that
fagging and bullying go on to
an extent which would not be
tolerated in any public school.</p>

<p>On October 19th a gleam of
light from within is afforded by
&ldquo;Olim Miles,&rdquo; who quotes a letter
from his son in the <i>Britannia</i>:
&ldquo;About the fagging for money, two
or three cadets have been found
out to be practising this disgraceful
form of larceny, and have
consequently been shunned by
everyone who calls himself a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>This is much more likely to
be a true statement of the case.
The youngster tacitly admits that
there may have been others who were not detected, but the
general feeling of the bulk of the cadets on the subject is,
no doubt, quite truthfully represented; indeed, one could
not imagine it possible that it could be otherwise.</p>

<p>However, this simple statement did not stem the tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another Wykehamist&rdquo; follows with an assertion of his
conviction that the tone is low in spite of favourable appearances;
and, among other things, he deprecates the method of
corporal punishment by means of a cane over tightened
flannel trousers, and says he is not satisfied as to discipline,
supervision, and moral training, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
October 20th, Admiral G.&nbsp;H. Richards is down upon the
last writer, asking, very pertinently, what right he has to
expect to be &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; on these points; says the best proof
of the efficiency of the <i>Britannia</i> is the officers she turns
out; he has had two sons there, and never found any cause
of complaint.</p>

<p>On October 22nd, Mr. T. Gibson Bowles, M.P., stands up
for the ship, and &ldquo;Through the Mill&rdquo; replies at length to
the editor of the <i>Western Morning News</i>, winding up by
advising parents to send their sons to &ldquo;one of the best schools
in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Etonian&rdquo; says that Admiral Richards naturally
avoids reference to corporal punishment and &ldquo;second class&rdquo;
punishment, which are brutal. Would it not be possible to
give the headship to a man used to boys, and with some
ideas of managing them beyond the stick and the &ldquo;second
class&rdquo;?</p>

<p>One does not quite see why the Admiral should &ldquo;naturally&rdquo;
avoid reference to corporal punishment, etc. Probably
his sons were well conducted, and did not need severe
measures which, indeed, were not often resorted to; but in
expressing his satisfaction with the ship as a school for his
boys he must in common reason be held to approve the whole
scheme, including the punishments alluded to when they are
needed. The last sentence of &ldquo;Old Etonian&rsquo;s&rdquo; letter, as
quoted above, can only be classified as impertinent ignorance&mdash;or
ignorant impertinence, whichever may be deemed most
suitable. His ideas are based on a conviction that no one
except a public school master knows anything about the
management of boys; which is a great error. There are
plenty of men&mdash;and a large proportion among the officers of
the Navy&mdash;who have a natural capacity in this respect, which
becomes apparent directly they get their opportunity; and
there are others&mdash;in public schools as well as elsewhere&mdash;who
have been managing boys all their lives, and have never
done it decently.</p>

<p>These are truisms; but in reply to a man who will venture
to hold up to ridicule, as a sort of bugbear with a big stick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
such men as Captain Digby and other captains of the
<i>Britannia</i>, truisms appear to be necessary.</p>

<p>Admiral Richards replies, October 26th, that officers of
education, ability, and life-long experience of discipline are
the best men to train young officers in their own service, and
asks what Wykehamists and Etonians would say if he and
others of his service were to dictate as to the management
of public schools.</p>

</div>

<p>The editor of the <i>Western Morning News</i> writes again on
October 27th, reiterating his former statements, which he
apparently discounts, however, by a quotation from a letter
written by the father of one of the cadets who was expelled by
Captain Digby. He says that his son and his contemporaries
went through it when first they joined, and had their turn at
fagging afterwards; and then, seeing that he has, by implication,
convicted his son of bullying, proceeds to describe how
&ldquo;one penny was exacted, in a thoroughly good-humoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
way, from boys passing a certain bridge; but there was no
thrashing or bullying used to extort it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Digby, for his part, says frankly:&mdash;&ldquo;It had, no
doubt, been going on for a long time, and, owing to the
reticence of youth, it took me a year to get to the bottom of
it; but I finally succeeded in getting rid of the principal
culprits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No doubt the &ldquo;reticence of youth&rdquo; is a very important
factor in all such cases, and it would be safe to assume also
that the captain had not been too well served by some of his
subordinates, who were either lax in supervision or failed to
realise the importance of a growing evil.</p>

<p>This was one of the unsatisfactory cycles or phases through
which most schools periodically pass; indeed, it is said that
they have recurred with great regularity, and each time, no
doubt, experience has dictated some new measures for the
future suppression of irregularities.</p>

<p>As a picture of &ldquo;The <i>Britannia</i> from Within,&rdquo; a little
booklet written by a cadet a year or two later may very well
be quoted from here. It is styled &ldquo;H.M.S. <i>Britannia</i>, the
Cradle of the Royal Navy: by one of the Babies,&rdquo; and sets
forth in a light vein the experiences of a few days in the
life of a cadet:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Preface</span></p>

<p>Being that part of a book which is seldom or never read, why need
I write one? It does not seem much in my line; but I may as
well remark that these notes, scribbled at odd times, are published
at the request of my friends, and dedicated</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="padright">To My Mother</span><br />
By <span class="smcap">Navilus</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let us follow our &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; throughout one of his specimen
days:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;5.25 a.m.&mdash;Bump! Bother the corporal!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now then, Mr. Jones, time for you to turn out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Jones has &lsquo;twos&rsquo; again, poor chap! But I wish the
corporal would not bump against my hammock when he is
waking other fellows.</p>

<p>I can hear Jones softly swearing to himself as he gets into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
his clothes, and I thank my stars that I still have time for
another snooze.</p>


<p class="break">Hullo! There go five bells already, and the bugle. Never
mind; the fourth term go first through the bath.</p>

<p>Time now, however. I struggle for&rsquo;ard, half asleep, through
the bath. All the fellows come up by degrees. Ugh! how
cold the water is! But it has the effect of waking us up
pretty quickly. How nice it is to be out and drying. I
mean to be dressed in good time to-day, as I have had enough
punishments lately.</p>

<p>Now to wash. This time the water is too hot, and it is
five minutes before I can bear it. Jones, having completed
his punishment, is washing alongside me.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s Smith at his tricks again&mdash;throwing water as
usual, and a cold stream pours down my back. I <em>must</em> go
for him. Another five minutes&rsquo; delay. I fall into conversation
with Jones, and am giving him good advice about his
various shortcomings, when first warning goes. We hurriedly
complete our ablutions, and go to our chests. Second warning.
Not half dressed, and here comes the corporal&mdash;bad
luck to him&mdash;with his pencil and paper.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Clear off the sleeping deck, there! Now then, Mr.
Martin, late again as usual; go on deck before breakfast, sir,&rsquo;
and my name is entered on the fateful bit of paper.</p>

<p>Jones is nearly dressed, and is at present engaged in his
devotions. The corporal stares at him, but proceeds on his
way. I have to go on the middle deck carrying my boots,
and put them on there. Just time to lace them up before the
bugle sounds &lsquo;Fall in,&rsquo; and the officer of the day begins his
inspection. This over, we march to the messroom to do an
hour&rsquo;s preparation. The Euclid is awfully hard; I am afraid
I shan&rsquo;t know it.</p>

<p>Bugle sounds &lsquo;Dismiss studies.&rsquo; I will not go on deck
yet. The corporal&rsquo;s memory may fail him, or he may be in a
soft mood and let me off. We all sit down, awaiting grace.
My spirits rise. But behold! the corporal&rsquo;s legs appear descending
the hatchway, and worse still, his burly form follows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
them! &lsquo;Now then, sir&rsquo; (addressing me), &lsquo;go up and fall in
on the &rsquo;alf deck.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is no help for it, so I take up my cap and
reluctantly obey. Lieutenant A&mdash;&mdash; is the officer of the day,
so he will let me off easy, perhaps. The corporal salutes
and addresses him: &lsquo;Mr. Martin, sir, for not being dressed
by second warning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The lieutenant asks if I have any excuse to offer: I have
none, and he orders me a day&rsquo;s &lsquo;four.&rsquo; This is a fairly easy
punishment, and I return to breakfast somewhat consoled. I
expect all the rolls have been bagged; but I find that Grey,
who sits next me, has secured me three. I thank him and
fall to. Here come the sausages round, followed by ham, and
a choice of tea or cocoa. Sausages are all very well in their
way, but they make you horribly thirsty. I manage, however,
to get two cups of cocoa, and consider I have made
a fairly good breakfast. I collect my books and proceed
to my study in the <i>Hindostan</i>, to look over my work for
the day.</p>

<p>Hullo! there are some &lsquo;news&rsquo; looking out of the ports;
I must give them a shower bath. I make a paper cone, and
filling it with water, empty it over them. It gets them
fairly on the neck: heads disappear. I try to master
the Euclid and trig. Some other fellows have dropped in by
now; they are fairly quiet.</p>

<p>8.50.&mdash;Bugle again, and the corporal&rsquo;s mellow tones: &lsquo;Clear
ship! Clear ship! Cadets on the poop!&rsquo; One by one we
obey the summons, and proceed to the poop of the <i>Britannia</i>.
Soon the bugle sounds &lsquo;Fall in&rsquo;; we are inspected, and
prayers are read by the chaplain, after which we march off to
the studies, and the real work of the day begins. I get questions
I know, and manage to stumble through my work fairly
well.</p>

<p>At five minutes to eleven we have a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
interval, and then do English for an hour, followed by French
for another hour. I am no good at French, so indulge in a
game of nibs with my neighbour, who does not love &lsquo;parley-voo&rsquo;
any more than I do. We are detected, worse luck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
and are rewarded with a &lsquo;mod&rsquo; each. (&lsquo;Moderate attention&rsquo;
in the daily report, involving one hour&rsquo;s extra drill.)</p>

<p>Bugle sounds &lsquo;Dismiss studies.&rsquo; I am not sorry, as I am
famishing, and it is pudding day, too. The bugle sounds
again for dinner, and we all assemble in the messroom. Grace
is said by one of the two chief captains, and here come the
joints and pies, wheeled round on small tables appropriated
to them. Roast mutton falls to the lot of my table; this is
<em>not</em> my favourite dish, and I get the servant to bring me some
beefsteak pie in its place. Meat course over, I help the tart&mdash;cherry,
with cream, and excellent. My enjoyment of it is
rather hindered by Brown, who is heaving bread at me;
however, he is spotted by the chief captain, and told to go
to the defaulters&rsquo; table at tea. Brown says it is all my fault
for looking such an ass, which may be true, but is not polite.
I vow vengeance on Brown: he will avoid me after dinner,
I expect. The tarts being polished off, and grace again said,
we get half an hour to ourselves before muster. I spend it in
the &lsquo;sanc&rsquo; (&lsquo;sanctuary,&rsquo; a special place in the messroom,
reserved for senior cadets) reading the <i>Strand</i>, which has
always something jolly in it. I am in the middle of a blood-curdling
tale, when the corporal comes to clear the messroom.
I shove the book in my drawer, and depart to the middle
deck. We fall in, and are marched off to studies. This
afternoon we have mathematics until 3.30, when we shift
into flannels, and make for the boats as fast as we can, with
towels and bathing-drawers. I am lucky, and get a shoreboat
soon, so secure a good place on the bathing stage.</p>

<p>It is a perfect day, just the day for a bathe; and here
comes the officer of the day ashore in a gig, with the bugler.</p>

<p>On reaching the stage they disembark, and the boat waits
about in case of accidents. The bugle sounds &lsquo;Advance,&rsquo; and
immediately there is a sound of great splashing, and the
water is alive with heads. I have a jolly swim out to one
of the sailing cutters, and boarding her get another dive
from her bow. Bugle sounds &lsquo;Retreat&rsquo; all too soon, and
out of the water we have to go, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</i>.</p>

<p>When dressed, I go and fall in for my punishment drill;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
but for this I should be in the cricket field. There are twenty
other chaps in the same box as myself; poles are served out
to us, and for a whole hour of this blessed afternoon we have
to do a variety of exercises, and double round the drill ground.
It is frightfully hot work, and I am glad when it is over, and
I can go up to the field and get refreshments at Stodger&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>A game of cricket is going on; other chaps are practising
at the nets; and some of the officers are playing, too, at the
first eleven nets. I find one of the tennis courts empty, and
get a game with three other fellows who have been doing
drill with me.</p>

<p>After two sets I go on board again, and, shifting out of
flannels, go down to the messroom and finish my story in the
<i>Strand</i>. I have time to read another before muster, after
which we march into the messroom for tea.</p>

<p>To-night we get cold meat, cake, bread and butter, and
tea or cocoa <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad lib</i>. An hour&rsquo;s preparation follows, and there
is time for a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s dancing before the band
stops. F. and I indulge in a wild <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas de quatre</i>, and have
another quarter of an hour to ourselves before prayers, which
take place at 9.15 in the messroom; and now, instead of
turning comfortably into my hammock, I have to do my
fours&mdash;viz. to stand for an hour on the middle deck before
undressing. It is precious dull work, as there are very few
chaps at the same business to-night. After half an hour is
up, I am the only one left. I can hear the fellows talking
and laughing on the sleeping deck. I think of many things,
but my thoughts grow confused, and I begin to yawn, and
nearly fall asleep standing. At last the corporal tells me the
hour is up, and I gladly go to my chest and undress and turn
in. After all, there is nothing more comfortable than a
hammock; and notwithstanding the snoring of Jones, which
is not melodious, I soon fall asleep, with pleasant thoughts
of to-morrow, for it promises to be fine, and I am going out
for a cruise in the <i>Wave</i>.</p>

<p>6.30.&mdash;I am wide awake this morning, and the sun is
streaming in through the port, so I know it is a fine day.
I turn out with alacrity, and am not behindhand in dressing;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
besides, I have only to put on my flannels. Muster over, my
class goes off to the <i>Wave</i>, with a couple of fourth term
classes, for shifting the topgallant masts and yards. The
<i>Wave</i> is a barque of about 300 tons, with auxiliary steam
power; full speed under steam, 4&frac12; knots. She is noted for
her rolling propensities. However, as she is now in the
harbour, just astern of the <i>Britannia</i>, she is as steady as
a rock, or nearly so.</p>

<p>It is not particularly interesting work shifting topgallant
masts in your third term, as only a few of the fourth term go
aloft, and the remainder of us stay down on deck, hauling on
ropes. I am at the foremast, and we get ours done much
more smartly than the fellows at the main, as we chance to
be a better lot. This sort of work goes on for an hour, when
we return to the <i>Britannia</i>, and have breakfast, feeling quite
ready for our porridge. Cold ham follows, and I make mine
into sandwiches, with rolls, to eat in the <i>Wave</i>, that is if
I still feel capable of eating when we are outside the harbour!</p>

<p class="caption">CHAPEL ON BOARD THE &ldquo;HINDOSTAN.&rdquo;<br />

</div>

<p>There is half an hour to spare after breakfast before we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
embark for our cruise. There is a stampede to the gangway
to see a German man-of-war just anchoring in the harbour
below Dartmouth. She is a great white steamer, full rigged,
and is used as a training-ship. We shall get a fine view of
her passing in the <i>Wave</i>. It is now time I was getting ready,
so I fetch my sextant from the instrument study, and wrap
up my sandwiches in a piece of paper, tying them up with
a lanyard. The wind is freshening, and I ask old Johnson,
the boatswain, what it will be like outside. He says: &lsquo;A
nice fresh breeze,&rsquo; and I know what that means! At last we
go down in the boat and are off. I pull the second stroke
oar, and we soon reach the <i>Wave</i> and scramble on board.
During the few minutes which elapse before the first
lieutenant arrives, the instructor shows us the various ropes,
explaining the use of them, and the boatswain tells us off to
our respective stations aloft. My place is on the fore top-sail-yard;
and now the lieutenant comes on board, and we slip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
from the buoy without delay, and steam down the harbour.
A quarter of an hour sees us outside, and the <i>Wave</i> begins
to keep up her character for rolling. Indeed, she seems fully
determined not to disappoint us in this respect.</p>

<p>We have orders to go aloft and loose the sails, which are
then sheeted home, and we go down from aloft to help hoist
them. She is steadier now the sails are set, and soon the
engines are stopped, and our progress is under sail alone.
After a little while we are sent aloft to reef top-sails, and
take in top-gallant sails. I get on the yardarm, where we
have to sit astride. It is splendid up here; the best place
of all, to my mind. The coast line is clearly visible, from
Start Point to Berry Head.</p>

<p class="caption">A SIGNALLING EXERCISE.</p>
</div>

<p>Having taken in a reef, we return on deck, and have a
quarter of an hour&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stand easy.&rsquo; By this time several
fellows seem to be curiously drawn to the lee side of the ship!
We, whose souls do <em>not</em> &lsquo;sicken on the heaving <i>Wave</i>,&rsquo; begin
to feel the pangs of hunger, and set to work to devour the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
provisions we have brought with us, in addition to the ship&rsquo;s
biscuit which is provided.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

alt="Cadets wait in line to receive their allowance" />
<p class="caption">POCKET MONEY.</p>
</div>

<p>Our &lsquo;Stand easy&rsquo; being at an end, an order is given to
start the engines full steam ahead; this is to get more way
on for lifeboat practice. To-day I am one of the lifeboat&rsquo;s
crew. The first lieutenant, throwing the lifebuoy into the
sea, raises a cry of &lsquo;Man overboard.&rsquo; Immediately the
engines are stopped and the main-yard squared to stop the
way of the ship. The lifeboat is manned and lowered, and
we row towards the supposed drowning man, and with all
promptitude rescue him from his watery grave.</p>

<p>On our return to the <i>Wave</i> there is a friendly rivalry
between the fore and after part of the cadets to hoist up the
lifeboat; the result being that the crew are in the comfortable
position of sitting in a boat at an angle of about forty-five
degrees, as the fore part are the stronger lot. However, we
soon manage to get on board, and we go about and make for
home; for so we come to regard the old hulk lying in the
Dart.</p>

<p>The order is given to get our sextants out of the charthouse;
we carry them aft to take the meridian altitude of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
sun. This is rather hard work while the ship is moving,
when you are not accustomed to it, but doubtless will come
easy in time. And now we are sent aloft to shake the reef
out of the top-sails; this is the work of two or three minutes
only, and we proceed towards the harbour mouth with
increased speed. The wind is freshening, but the motion is
not felt so much now that it is dead aft. While we are passing
between the old castles of Kingswear and Dartmouth we
go aloft to take in the sails. I am not on the yardarm this
time, but next to it. While the &lsquo;Descent of Man&rsquo; has lost
him the gymnastic properties of his ancestors, a sailor&rsquo;s life
brings out the power of &lsquo;Ascent in Man,&rsquo; judging by the
prehensile talent so quickly acquired by his hands and feet.
Think of this and take comfort, O mothers! whose curly-haired
Harrys and Willies are climbing aloft on the rigging,
at the apparently imminent peril of their necks! We are
past the Kingswear pontoon before the sails are furled, and
we are now steaming up the harbour at our usual breathless
speed, at which rate it is not long before we again make
fast to the buoy and return on board, most of us having
thoroughly enjoyed our cruise, and had our appetites whetted
for the good dinner which is awaiting us.</p>

<p>After our meal we do the usual hour and a half&rsquo;s work,
which to-day is mathematics, and then have our dip. F. and
I make for the cricket field, and spend a short time playing
at the nets, there being no game got up for to-day.</p>

<p>It is pretty hot this afternoon, and we should enjoy a bit
of the cool breeze we had outside in the morning. But this
being unavailable, we consider strawberries and cream would
be a good substitute, and accordingly make for the stodge
shop, where we lay in a store of the article mentioned, and
feel refreshed.</p>

<p>F. is the fortunate possessor of a camera, and considers
this will be a good opportunity to go down to the dark-room
and develop the photographs he has been taking lately.
I suggest getting one of the blue boats, and rowing out to
photograph the German man-of-war lying in the harbour.
We manage to wheedle a skiff out of the boat-keeper, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
soon making for her. We get two or three views, and while
preparing to return are hailed by one of the officers, and
invited on board.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">

</div>

<p>This is too fine a chance to lose, and although we have
not had previous leave, we accept the tempting invitation so
cordially given, and, securing our boat alongside, are conveyed
to the gunroom. Here are a few officers, at whom we look
with great interest. All speak English fairly well, and are
imbibing lager beer and smoking. We are at once offered
beer and cigars, and indulge in a weed apiece, but no more,
considering discretion to be the better part of valour. It is
difficult to refuse our hosts, who so cordially press upon us
their hospitality. F. imagines he can speak German, having,
when a baby, had a German nurse who knew no English.
I judge, from close observation, that at that remote period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
of his existence he was unable to speak in either language
himself. But, of course, he cannot let slip this opportunity
of airing his linguistic proclivities.</p>

<p>He photographs the officers in a group: looking at my
watch, I find it is high time to be off, in fact the recall must
have been up for nearly a quarter of an hour. So, taking
a hearty leave of our genial hosts, we step into our boat, and
pull quickly up the harbour. We have to return the boat to
its place, and find the boat-keeper in a towering rage, promising
to report us both. His promises are always like
pie-crust in this respect, so our equanimity is not greatly
disturbed, and we are just in time to catch the pinnace for
returning on board.</p>

<p>The corporal thinks we look suspicious, for some reason
best known to himself, and considers it necessary to search
us for &lsquo;stodge,&rsquo; which it is against rules to bring on board.
We are redolent of tobacco, of course, which does not escape
his olfactory sense, but he has no proof against us, and has to
let us go. Sold again!</p>

<p>We go on the sleeping deck to shift, and after muster
march to the messroom for tea. Then preparation, and half
an hour to ourselves till prayers. No &lsquo;fours&rsquo; to-night, and
I feel quite ready to turn into my hammock when the time
comes.</p>

<p>There is a slip on my hammock! I feel it going! I
try to turn out, but am too late. I clutch wildly at
Jones&rsquo;s hammock. Bump! We are both down, and
the other fellows in great delight at the tableau. It turns
out to have been a trick of Jones&rsquo;s; so he has been well
punished.</p>

<p>Calm once more restored. After a little conversation, I
am once more in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>On board H.M.S. <i>Britannia</i> one day is very much like
another, which, though somewhat monotonous, has the
advantage (if it be one) of making time fly fast. The studies
are varied by seamanship, including signalling by semaphore,
flag, and Morse systems; working anchors and cables, learnt
by a model on wheels, which is kept on the middle deck;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
knots and splices; working sailing cutters; the steam picket
boat, and other such oily delights.</p>

<p>To-day, however, we have mathematics all the morning,
from nine o&rsquo;clock until midday, with an interval at 10.30 for
receiving our weekly pocket money, consisting of the noble
sum of one shilling, which the third and fourth terms are
entitled to receive also on Wednesdays, if their parents see fit.</p>

<p>Next Monday being a whole holiday, however, the chaps
who are lucky enough to have friends in the neighbourhood,
and are going on leave to them until Monday, get extra
pocket money, which may not exceed five shillings, added to
their railway fare. Having no friend to invite me, I have
arranged to go up the river to Totnes in a blue boat with
some other fellows, and we are to receive our extra pocket
money on Monday morning.</p>

<p>We fall in according to our terms and march round to the
half deck, the fourth term leading, the others following in
order. Dinner hour on &lsquo;halves&rsquo; is twelve o&rsquo;clock, and it
follows, therefore, that we are famishing by the time our
evening meal is ready, which is not until seven o&rsquo;clock. The
consequence is that a great deal of money finds its way into
the stodge shop, and our pocket money is exhausted at
a rapid rate. All the better for old &lsquo;Stodger,&rsquo; and for Dawe,
whose shop is open on half-holidays only.</p>

<p>The cadets going on leave took their departure before
dinner, rowing ashore to the platform abreast of the <i>Britannia</i>,
where trains stop by special order.</p>

<p>I have arranged to walk over to Stoke Fleming this afternoon
with F., and accordingly we start as soon as we can land
after dinner. We take it easy, so it is an hour before we arrive
at our destination. The road leads across the hills at the
back of Dartmouth towards the open sea, which here breaks
at the foot of steep and high cliffs. We are each provided
with a book, and finding a shady place on the cliffs, we have
a rest and a read.</p>

<p>We can see the schooner yacht <i>Syren</i> at sea, with a party
of cadets out for a cruise. The schooner <i>Arrow</i>, for the first
and second terms, is not yet in sight. I expect she will have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
some difficulty in getting out of the harbour, the wind being
light and the tide against her, and the <i>Arrow</i> sailing about
as well as an average washing-tub. The <i>Syren</i> seems to be
rolling rather, as there is a slight swell from yesterday.</p>

<p>It is nearly four o&rsquo;clock now, and we begin to feel the
pangs of hunger, so consider it is about time to proceed on
our way to the shop held by Mrs. Fox and Mrs. Martin, commonly
known as &lsquo;Ma Fox&rsquo;s,&rsquo; where a capital tea can be
obtained for a very moderate sum. &lsquo;Ma Fox&rsquo; is pretty well
up in the manners and customs of cadets. She sports the
Prince of Wales&rsquo;s feathers over the shop door, having been
patronised by the two Royal cadets. F. and I get the third
term room to ourselves, and order a meal consisting of cocoa,
potted meat, sardines, and bread and jam, to which we do
ample justice; and having squared up with the old dame, we
walk slowly back to the field, where we see the last of the
cricket match between our first eleven and one of the neighbouring
cricket clubs. We are victorious again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above extract gives a very fair idea of life on board,
from the cadet&rsquo;s point of view. The description of the trip to
Totnes on the &ldquo;whole&rdquo; does not intimately concern the
<i>Britannia</i>; but one or two more extracts must be given, as
throwing a little more light on certain points.</p>

<p>The writer describes how, on Sunday afternoon, he and
two comrades land on the Kingswear side, taking with them
two &ldquo;news&rdquo; who are often in their company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ralston, another of their term, respectfully accosts me,
and asks permission to come too. He is a likely looking lad,
so I graciously consent to his joining us. Arrived on shore,
we repair to our &lsquo;sanc,&rsquo; which is a nook we have chosen in a
small wood. It is roofed over with branches woven together,
and the &lsquo;news&rsquo; set to work to gather fresh bracken for us.
When we consider it sufficiently comfortable, we establish
ourselves with our books, and they proceed to a small &lsquo;sanc&rsquo;
of their own, within hail of us, which they have made in their
leisure time. They are also provided with literature. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
part of the fearful fagging system, of which so many complaints
are made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, it will be noted, was three years after the commotion
in 1891; so, apparently, there was still some talk about the
treatment of &ldquo;news.&rdquo; The subject is once more touched
upon by the &ldquo;Baby&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Much has been written and said lately about the
<i>Britannia</i>&mdash;the system of teaching, the bullying practice,
etc. This latter is fast disappearing under the wise rule of
the latest captains. There will always be something of the
kind in a mild form in any institution in the shape of a public
school, and the <i>Britannia</i> is nothing more or less. Fagging
for money is now unheard of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The discipline is of necessity strict, but not unduly
severe; and the instructors are popular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is almost an impossibility to make the work sufficiently
practical when there are so many subjects to take up; but
there <em>is</em> practical work, as the readers of this paper will see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The writer concludes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Soon the &lsquo;whole&rsquo; is nothing but a memory, one of the
many happy ones we shall ever retain of our old training-ship
on the Dart, and which will, doubtless, often rise up before us
in the years to come, when we look forward to being, <em>at least</em>,
useful members of that profession which is England&rsquo;s glory.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus far &ldquo;Navilus.&rdquo; His little book was written just
before the advent of Captain A.&nbsp;W. Moore, whose period of
command was marked by some drastic alterations.</p>

<p>There are not wanting those who assert that reform was
urgently needed in some respects, and that Captain Moore
was expected to assume the r&ocirc;le of reformer.</p>

<p>The most important alterations were in disciplinary
matters, and one is embodied in the following orders for the
lieutenants:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each lieutenant will have special charge of a term from their entry
into the <i>Britannia</i> until they pass out, and will be responsible for their
instruction in seamanship, gymnastics, boating, swimming, etc., and is
to keep a record of each cadet&rsquo;s progress. He will teach personally the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
&ldquo;rule of the road&rdquo; and &ldquo;ship construction,&rdquo; and at times such other
subjects as he may think fit.</p>

<p>One of the lieutenants will perform the duties of officer of the day,
and a second lieutenant will be present at all musters of cadets, and
attend in the recreation grounds when cadets are landed.</p>

<p>A weekly report of each term will be rendered by the lieutenants,
to be given to the executive officer on Monday morning at divisions for
the captain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advantage of this system is at once apparent: each
lot of boys, when they join, find themselves placed under the
care of an officer, who remains as
their instructor, monitor, and &ldquo;sea
daddy&rdquo; during the whole period
of their sojourn on board. He soon
gets to know each one intimately,
and they can go to him for advice
in any difficulties which may crop
up. He takes an interest in their
conduct and progress, and encourages
healthy emulation and a proper
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> among them; indeed,
he may do an immense amount of
good, of which the lieutenants were
not afforded the opportunity under
former regulations.</p>

</div>

<p>The arrangement is also a far more satisfactory one for the
lieutenants, who thus have a definite line of work prescribed,
instead of the somewhat vague position which they used to
occupy.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that nobody ever thought of it before!
That it has worked well from the outset everyone is agreed.</p>

<p>Another disciplinary measure was the abolition of cadets&rsquo;
corporals, with their chief man&mdash;master-at-arms or serjeant-major&mdash;and
the substitution of a cadets&rsquo; gunner, known as
&ldquo;chief of the staff,&rdquo; with four chief gunner&rsquo;s mates under him,
one to each term.</p>

<p>Everyone who knows anything about naval matters will
appreciate the advantage of having a gunner placed in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
position. The warrant officers are an admirable body of men;
they have been &ldquo;through the mill&rdquo; in the lower grades, know
their work practically and thoroughly, and usually display
considerable capacity for command and a quite remarkable
amount of tact in the discharge of their duties. The gunners
are the pick of the &ldquo;warrants,&rdquo; and there would be no difficulty
in finding a man for the newly created post in the
<i>Britannia</i> with every possible qualification for it; moreover,
he ranks in the Navy above a midshipman or cadet, so that
there is no incongruity about his position of authority.</p>

<p>The chief gunner&rsquo;s mates are the &ldquo;makings&rdquo; of gunners,
and consequently the best subordinates possible in this
department.</p>

<p>The chief of the staff has to keep the cadets&rsquo; defaulters
books, see all punishments on board properly carried out,
take charge of the sleeping decks, messroom, servants&rsquo; mess
place, and to see that the cadets&rsquo; servants are clean and tidy
and perform their duties properly; and is, altogether, a sort
of sub-executive officer, and no doubt invaluable to the
commander.</p>

<p>These changes from within were speedily followed by
others, of equal importance, from without; for in January
1897, the Admiralty issued a new circular, initiating radical
alterations in the regulations for entry and training.</p>

<p>The limits of age for entry were altered as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cadets entering January 15th and May 15th, 1897, 13&frac12; to 15;
September 15th, 1897, 13&frac34; to 15&frac14;; and January 15th, 1898, and afterwards,
14 to 15&frac12;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in accordance with the views expressed by the
committee of 1885, who were of opinion that the subjects
taught in the <i>Britannia</i> could not be properly learnt by boys
so young. If this new arrangement was in recognition of the
correctness of these views, it was certainly tardy!</p>

<p>However, this was not the only alteration; there were to
be, as before, four terms spent by a cadet in the training ship;
but instead of there being two terms in each year, involving
two years&rsquo; training, there were to be three in each year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
thus reducing the time spent on board to about fifteen
months.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CADETS&rsquo; HOSPITAL.<br />

</div>

<p>This would appear to involve the assumption that the
increased age would render it possible not only that a cadet
should learn the subjects better, but that he should do so in
nine months less time.</p>

<p>There are, however, some slight modifications in the
&ldquo;Course of Studies,&rdquo; as set forth respectively in the former
regulations and the new ones. In the latter astronomy,
pneumatics, light, and electricity disappear from the regular
tabulated curriculum; English&mdash;including English history,
naval history, and geography&mdash;is also omitted; but all these
subjects still find their place under the heading of &ldquo;Lectures,&rdquo;
so the alteration is more in theory than practice. Euclid is
modified to a certain extent; but, taking it all round, the
course is a pretty stiff one for fifteen months.</p>

<p>However, it does not appear to be too hard for the boys;
it is still in force, and, out of 979 cadets presenting themselves
at the final examinations since 1897, only twelve, or 1&middot;2
per cent., have failed. In 1902 and 1903 (to anticipate a little)
there have, up to August last, been no failures, which is highly
creditable both to the boys and their instructors.</p>

In 1896 (as an improvement upon the brigs formerly suggested),
the <i>Racer</i>, a barque-rigged screw sloop of 970 tons,
was attached to the <i>Britannia</i> for the purpose of taking out
the third and fourth term cadets cruising in the Channel.
She had accommodation for one class at a time, and was in
command of a commander for navigating duties.</p>

<p>The usual routine was that the class should embark from
Monday to Friday; the lieutenant of the term went with his
boys, assumed the duties of executive officer, and instructed
the cadets in seamanship; the engineer taught them steam,
and the commander practical navigation. The vessel cruised
under sail as a general rule, using steam as necessary to make
her ports.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Racer</i> season extended from April 1st to November 1st,
or later if desirable; she was laid up during the winter, and
was ready for sea by March 15th.</p>

<p>This was a decided step in advance, and there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
doubt the cadets derived immense benefit from these short
cruises, which must, moreover, in fine summer weather, have
been exceedingly pleasant&mdash;after the usual &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; had been
paid to Neptune!</p>

<p>On March 17th, 1897, while both the captain and the wardroom
officers were entertaining guests at dinner, a sensational
incident occurred. The <i>Britannia</i>, it will be recollected, has
a solitary mast; not a large one for a vessel of her size, but
sufficiently lofty to be a target for lightning, and provided
with the usual copper strip for conductor. While dinner was
in progress there was a shock, plainly felt throughout the
ship, and a blinding glare, while a tremendous peal of thunder
simultaneously resounded overhead; the ship trembled from
stem to stern, and some of the occupants of the wardroom
even imagined that they saw the lightning flash through the
room. There was no doubt about it, the ship was struck by
lightning. It had struck the copper band round the &ldquo;truck&rdquo;&mdash;the
small round disc which surmounts the mast, and carries
the blocks for the flag halyards&mdash;split the truck, burnt
through the wire strap of the signal halyard block, and
travelled down the conductor, which is supposed to run right
down the mast and pass out to connect with the copper
sheathing of the ship under water; perhaps it did, but
the lightning apparently stopped short at the galvanised roof
through which the mast passes, and spread itself out over the
iron, which was very wet. The wrecked truck is kept in a glass
case between decks as a memento of this unusual experience.</p>

<p>In the Jubilee procession of 1897 the cadets played a
prominent part, and were everywhere hailed with enthusiasm.
One hundred of them went to London on this occasion, and
were put up for the night at Greenwich College.</p>

<p>They left Kingswear at 10.50 a.m. on June 21st, six in a
compartment, with an enormous pasty and a bottle of ginger-beer
each. At Bristol buns and ginger-beer were served out
during the stoppage, and they were sustained for the
remainder of the journey to Paddington, which was reached
at 5.20. Here there were &rsquo;buses waiting to convey them to
Charing Cross, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for Greenwich.</p>

An early start was necessary next morning, so they breakfasted
at 6.45 a.m., left at 8, and reached Charing Cross at 9,
whence they marched to the Admiralty, where Mr. Goschen,
the First Lord, had made all hospitable provision for them.
At 10.30 they marched to Buckingham Palace to salute the
Queen as she drove off; then back to the Admiralty to a
sumptuous lunch. At 1.15 fall in again, and march to the
Palace to mount guard on the Queen&rsquo;s return. Then they
returned to the Admiralty for a &ldquo;stand easy,&rdquo; and lay about
on the grass in the First Lord&rsquo;s garden, which they found
very pleasant; and the enjoyment of their repose was presently
enhanced by the appearance of unlimited ginger-beer,
served out by Mr. Goschen&rsquo;s two sons. Finally, tea was
served in the First Lord&rsquo;s house, and they marched to Paddington
in time for their train, at six o&rsquo;clock; very tired&mdash;and
no wonder&mdash;but happy. What time they got on board is not
stated; but, doubtless, they were allowed a good lie in next
morning.</p>

<p>Those who did not go to London for the procession were
taken to see the Spithead Review, on the 26th, which was,
perhaps, still better worth seeing.</p>

<p>Jubilee year was further signalised by the institution of
the Queen&rsquo;s medal, to be awarded annually, by the vote and
selection of his comrades, to the cadet who is deemed to be
foremost in good conduct and gentlemanly bearing in all
respects.</p>

<p>This honorable trophy was awarded at Christmas, 1897, to
Midshipman J.&nbsp;W. Scott, who had already gone to sea, and
was serving in H.M.S. <i>Astr&aelig;a</i>; Cadet G.&nbsp;B. Alexander
receiving the &ldquo;diploma,&rdquo; which is a necessary step towards
receiving the medal next time.</p>

<p>The editor is busy again asking questions. &ldquo;How is it,&rdquo;
he wants to know, &ldquo;that so few cadets are to be seen dancing
in the evening? Hardly one of the third and fourth terms
is to be seen. They are hard at work, no doubt, but a quarter
of an hour devoted to dancing every night, instead of &lsquo;<i>x</i>,&rsquo;
would invigorate their brains to further efforts in pursuit of
that wily letter. They will have sometimes to attend dances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
and if they have to say they can&rsquo;t, what a nuisance they
become to themselves and others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most true; and, as we recollect, dancing was included in
the curriculum in the old Academy, and for a considerable
portion of the College time; it is not easy to see where time
could be found for it in the course on board the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>An interesting gift was made to the ship about this time,
being no other than the spectacles worn by Captain Marryat.
The donor was Mr. Oscar de Satag&eacute;, who was a godson of
the great naval novelist.</p>

<p>Many reflections are suggested by these relics. Marryat
probably wore them while he wrote some of his novels. Do
any of those amazing scenes which he so graphically describes
still linger in the lenses? Shall we, if we put them on, be
able to see Mr. Midshipman Easy strutting about with the
Articles of War under his arm, and laying down the law to
his superiors, or murmuring, &ldquo;Duty before decency&rdquo; as the
unlucky Mr. Biggs stands trouserless on the gangway? Or

shall we see that marvellous picture, dear to every seaman,
presented in &ldquo;Peter Simple,&rdquo; where the <i>Diomede</i> just weathers
the point, and her courses fly in shivers as she scrapes clear?
Well, well, if they were known to have such properties, those
spectacles, it is to be feared, would not last long!</p>

<p>Another gift to the <i>Britannia</i> in the &rsquo;nineties was the
magnificent model of the ill-fated <i>Victoria</i>, made for the
Naval Exhibition of 1891, and presented by Messrs. Armstrong
and Co. It fills up one side of the model room, and
must have taken some getting in there; but sailors do not stick
at trifles: if you confronted them with a camel and a needle,
they would immediately set to work to rig the necessary
tackle for &ldquo;reeving&rdquo; the camel through the eye.</p>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i> did not escape discussion in the papers
during the &rsquo;nineties. On January 10th, 1891, a correspondent,
under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Blue Jacket,&rdquo; starts the
question of the cadets&rsquo; food, stating that he understands it
is far from satisfactory, and inquires whether it is as good as
they had in their former schools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;M.,&rdquo; a former <i>Britannia</i> boy, says he always found
the food good and abundant&mdash;and he ought to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Parent&rdquo; says his boy informs him that the victuals are
of the most inferior description, the butter and meat being
often uneatable; and alleges that some cadets who complained
of the butter on one occasion were punished.</p>

<p>Possibly &ldquo;A Parent&rsquo;s&rdquo; son may not have been quite
ingenuous. Any complaint would be promptly investigated by
the officer of the day, and, if well founded, immediate steps
would be taken to remedy the matter; an unfounded complaint,
on the other hand, particularly if reiterated, would be
a likely occasion for a small dose of &ldquo;fours,&rdquo; as a reminder
not to be unduly troublesome. The allegation that boys who
made justifiable complaints about food were punished for it
requires something more than the authority of &ldquo;A Parent&rsquo;s&rdquo;
son to make it go down. &ldquo;Navilus&rdquo; does not convey the
impression that there is anything wrong with either the
quantity or quality of the food; on the contrary, he is rather
enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
There are usually, in every school and college, a certain
number of students who, either from perversity or from having
been unduly pampered at home, make a point of finding fault
with the food, however good; they imagine it is &ldquo;swagger&rdquo;
to know how these things ought to be done.</p>

<p>A young commissioned officer who was a member <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
tem.</i> of a very excellent, not to say sumptuous, mess was once
known to insert in the complaint book a bitter wail because
<em>only three sorts of cheese</em> were handed round at mess. This is
the kind of hardship which should not be silently endured!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, messmen or stewards do undoubtedly go
wrong at times, if not kept very sharply under supervision,
and inferior stuff is sometimes supplied without being discovered
for a time by the heads.</p>

<p>Well, we have reached the end of the &rsquo;nineties; but there
is a small slice of the twentieth century to be dealt with before
concluding this chapter.</p>

<p>The augmentation in age, by which cadets might enter
after January, 1898, as old as 15&frac12;, was certain to result,
sooner or later, in some very big boys being entered; and the
following remarks in the <i>Britannia Magazine</i> for Christmas,
1901, appear to indicate that a contingent had arrived, in
September, of cadets who were considerably more prominent
for length than breadth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our latest brand of naval cadets is assuming a weird
shape: we are assured by the doctors and the Physical
Development Society that our recent plague has produced a
hitherto unknown specimen of the naval officer in embryo.
It scarcely seems credible; but having the authorities to back
us up with statistics, we feel safe in our statement&mdash;that the
various forms of torture have revealed the fact that, although
there has been an enormous increase in height, chest girth
and weight have been sadly on the decrease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;recent plague&rdquo; referred to is possibly a severe
epidemic of influenza which visited the ship in the spring of
1901, and caused a good deal of talk at the time; it died hard,
and there were some deaths from complications, pneumonia
and so on.</p>

There appears to have been a sort of jealousy or inimical
feeling about the <i>Britannia</i> which is always cropping up, and
finding vent in letters to the <i>Times</i>&mdash;the indignant Briton&rsquo;s
great resource&mdash;and which does not seem easy to account for.
In the bullying affair, before alluded to, the captain was busy
detecting culprits and putting it down before anyone wrote to
the Press, and yet the busy newspaper correspondents persisted
in saddling him, and the whole system, with the blame of it.
And similarly, in the case of the epidemic in 1901, everybody
and everything was held accountable except the well-known
capricious nature of the ailment, which crops up unexpectedly
in a household or a community, and as suddenly disappears;
no one knows how it got there, and its very name implies a
mystery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Father of Cadets&rdquo; writes: &ldquo;I have been informed that
for about sixteen years&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> since the ships have been at
Dartmouth&mdash;the sewage has been discharged from the vessel
into the river, where, though it is mostly washed away by the
tide, part must sink into deeper water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is certainly a very ill-informed parent, who should
have applied to his sons for some information before taking
up his pen. In the first place, the <i>Britannia</i> had, in March,
1901, been, not sixteen but over thirty-seven years in the
Dart; and where, in the name of common-sense, did he expect
the sewage to be discharged from the ship except into the
river? This is obviously a case of &ldquo;any stick is good enough
to beat a dog with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A refreshing contrast is presented by the letter of another
father of a cadet, Mr. N.&nbsp;C. Dobson, <i>emeritus</i> Professor of
Surgery, who says that he has been on board several times,
and is quite satisfied that the condition of the ship has had
nothing to do with the outbreak.</p>

<p>In this he is confirmed by the official report of Professor
Corfield, a hygienic expert, who was requested by the Admiralty
to investigate the causes, and who speaks most highly of
the sanitary condition of the ship, and says, in effect, that the
disease got on board in some manner which it is impossible
to detect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
Another writer attempts to put the blame on the food, and
sundry allegations are made against Dartmouth itself, which
draw forth a reply from the town clerk, who produces official
statistics to disprove the statements.</p>

<p>Nothing, in the eyes of some people, can be commended
in the poor old <i>Brit.</i> or the place where she is moored. The
captains are all incapable, the officers and masters are worse,
the position is insanitary, and nothing is right, in short,
except the excellent officers which this dreadful institution
turns out! It would not be precisely fulsome if some credit
were accorded to the captains and officers for this result, and
a small share to the Admiralty for selecting, as a rule, the
right men for the post.</p>

<p>However, to quote our friend the editor of the <i>Britannia
Magazine</i>, &ldquo;it is not well to be cynical!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Easter, 1902, the <i>Britannia Magazine</i> says:&mdash;&ldquo;Rumours
of an increased number in the next entry of cadets are rife,
which intelligence, while possibly gladdening the hearts of
some hundreds of parents, who are naturally selfishly interested,
brings to the authorities&rsquo; notice that the additional
number have somehow to be accommodated. Various suggestions
have been made, but none, to our mind, feasible. A
third term cadet has it from the best quarters that a brig is
to be moored astern of the <i>Britannia</i>. Another has heard
that the senior term captains are to relieve the marine
orderlies from their tedious night watch keeping in order to
save hammock space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rumour was not without some foundation; but, fortunately,
none of the drastic measures alluded to above were
found to be necessary.</p>

<p>On March 7th, 1902, the King and Queen came down to
lay the foundation-stone of the new College. This was, of
course, a tremendous f&ecirc;te day for Dartmouth generally, and
the <i>Britannia</i> in particular. Their Majesties arrived in a
special train at Kingswear, and crossed the harbour in the
Great Western Railway Company&rsquo;s little steamer the <i>Dolphin</i>,
which was profusely decorated. A large wooden pavilion was
erected near the site of the College, handsomely hung with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
flags, etc., of various colours. The foundation-stone is a block
of Cornish granite, which is to form the base of a column
60 feet high on the left of the main entrance. The casket to
contain the coins and records, and the mallet, were made of
oak from the old <i>Britannia</i>, and there was, of course, a silver
trowel, which was designed by the architect, Mr. Aston Webb.</p>

<p class="caption">THE KING&rsquo;S VISIT, MARCH 7, 1902.<br />

</div>

<p>All was going off swimmingly, when it was discovered that
the medals, which the King, after declaring the stone &ldquo;well
and truly laid,&rdquo; was to present to sundry persons, had been
left on board the ancient and much-bedizened <i>Dolphin</i>!</p>

<p>What was to be done? The failure of the captain of the
<i>Britannia</i>, or whoever was responsible, to produce the medals
at the proper moment would, of course, be immediately
followed by the mandate, &ldquo;Off with his head!&rdquo; or at the
least, &ldquo;To the Tower with the knave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, a saviour was found in the person of Lieutenant
Woollcombe, who was mounted in some official capacity, and
who, on learning of the impending disaster, stuck his spurs in
his horse and tore at full gallop through the town to the
pontoon, where the <i>Dolphin</i> was found lying; he seized the
packet and thundered back again, arriving in time to save
the captain&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>The magazine has something to say about this feat:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed with magnificent weather, everything went
smoothly, except for one slight incident, which introduced the
Deputy-Master of the Horse in the character of Gilpin (wasn&rsquo;t
it?) in his celebrated ride to York; and if the shedding of
garments had continued, we are not quite certain that the
r&ocirc;le of Godiva would not better have suited him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is some unkind allusion here which is not quite
apparent to the uninitiated: it would appear as though the
wild horseman had hastily dispensed with some of his
garments as he rode; and, for an officer in full, gold-plated,
stand-up-collar uniform, this is indeed a difficult and daring
feat, especially if he contrived, while still at full gallop, to
replace them before he arrived in the royal presence.</p>

The magazine proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;We were lucky enough to
witness an excellent cinematograph a few days after their
Majesties had been with us, showing in detail their movements
outside the pavilion; and the picture showing the arrival of
the Royal carriage was greeted with enthusiastic applause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pleasure of seeing one&rsquo;s own face in print is a mixed
and doubtful one, even when in miniature: but, magnified to
about double the original and working size, it becomes an
atrocity, and the King&rsquo;s guard will, we sincerely hope, forgive
the jeers which greeted their appearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among other competitions instituted in these later days
was a poem; at first sight, it might seem more appropriate to
include this among the <i>Britannia</i> games, but the following
prize poem, by Cadet A.&nbsp;H. Taylor, demands a better fate:&mdash;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;tinned air&rdquo; is a right merry conceit; it is to be
hoped that the prophetic words of the last verse may come
true in case of war. We are doing a good deal of business in
the matter of &ldquo;tinned air&rdquo; in England just now, which ought
to assist in keeping the &ldquo;meteor flag&rdquo; flying.</p>

<p>The officers who commanded the <i>Britannia</i> during the
&rsquo;nineties&mdash;and after, are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Captain A.&nbsp;B. Thomas, appointed September 8th, 1892.<br />
Captain A.&nbsp;W. Moore, appointed April 17th, 1894.<br />
Captain the Hon. A.&nbsp;G. Curzon-Howe, appointed April 21st, 1897.<br />
Captain M.&nbsp;P. O&rsquo;Callaghan, appointed February 20th, 1900.<br />
Captain C.&nbsp;H. Cross, appointed April 22nd, 1903.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Captain Thomas had to resign his appointment through
ill-health. Captain Cross is still in command, and will
probably see the end of the <i>Britannia</i> as at present constituted.</p>

<p>During the &rsquo;nineties no fewer than 1,554 cadets entered,
which, together with 618 in the next three years, makes a
total of 2,172 in the thirteen years under consideration in this
chapter. On this head some details will be found in the
concluding chapter.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N this chapter will be included not only cricket and
football, but some account of regattas, athletic sports,
etc.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, records are not available very far back, as
a regular account is only to be obtained from the <i>Britannia
Magazine</i>, which was started in 1884. There were cricket
matches inserted in the local papers, as referred to in the
opening article in the magazine, in which also it is hinted
that they were not always very accurate.</p>

<p>That the <i>Britannia</i> boys and their officers have for many
years been very keen about games is, however, an undoubted
fact; and the formation and subsequent improvement
of the playing fields at Dartmouth has afforded them
every opportunity for indulging their taste in this respect.
Portland was, of course, a wretched place all round, for games
or any other purpose: you might arrange a football match,
and find that the weather did not admit of landing, nor were
prohibitory gales by any means unknown even in summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
Since those days, also, there has been a great deal more
attention paid to these matters in all schools, except perhaps
in the chief public schools, where they have always been pursued
with some system.</p>

<p>In 1874, as has been seen, the cadets&rsquo; professional was
called before the Admiralty committee to give his views as
to the physique and capabilities of the cadets at cricket, and
it was there stated that they took a great interest in the game,
and were frequently victorious against school elevens of older
boys.</p>

<p>In those matches, also, in which they play &ldquo;full strength,&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;pro.&rdquo; and officers, there appear invariably to have
been some among the latter who were exceptionally good,
sometimes nearly the whole eleven being made up of them.
It may be that a certain prowess in athletics is taken into
account at the Admiralty among the qualifications of a lieutenant
or instructor for appointment to the <i>Britannia</i>; it is
certainly worth considering, and should turn the scale between
two officers, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">c&aelig;teris paribus</i>. Boys are all subject to seasons
of slackness, and do not moreover always realise the value of
games in promoting the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mens sana in corpore sano</i>, and the
importance of the advice and co-operation of their superiors
in these matters can scarcely be overrated. A little practice
is worth a ton of precept, and when the lads find that the
lieutenant who inspects them at divisions, the instructor
who teaches them spherical trigonometry, the doctor who
physics them in the sick bay, or the paymaster who sends
in the account to their parents are well able to take a bat
and show them how to play a fast &ldquo;yorker,&rdquo; or bowl them
with a &ldquo;break-back&rdquo; on occasions, there is sure to be a
far keener spirit about cricket than if they were left to
themselves.</p>

<p>In all these branches there have been notable cricketers in
the <i>Britannia</i>, nor must the Engineer officers be omitted&mdash;of
whom more anon.</p>

<p>One of the earliest matches recorded in the magazine is
Officers <i>v.</i> Cadets, on May 10th, 1884, of which the score is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Thomas, who was a mighty batsman, magnanimously
retired after making his century, or the juniors
would have come off with a worse beating; he and Captain
Bainbridge, it will be noticed, made 146 between them
out of 165. Cadet Nugent appears to have been a deadly
bowler, and had the assurance to bowl his captain for a
&ldquo;duck.&rdquo; This feat, however, fades into insignificance compared
with that of a stalwart midshipman in the Channel
Squadron some years earlier who, with a tremendously hard
square cut, knocked the Admiral off his legs at point, and sent
him limping off the field!</p>

<p>Matches with various clubs and schools in the vicinity of
Dartmouth recur, of course, many times: the balance of
victories is greatly in favour of the <i>Britannia</i>. The professional
Underwood, whose name appears so many times in
the scoring sheet, was there for a long time, and did excellent
service, both in coaching the cadets and in winning first
eleven matches, frequently making a long score and taking
his full share of wickets.</p>

<p>The following are some among the chief matches played in
1884:&mdash;</p>

<p>May 17.&mdash;<i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> Engineer Students:
<i>Britannia</i>, 121; Engineers, 94.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
May 21.&mdash;<i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> Newton College:</p>

<p>Newton College, 93; <i>Britannia</i>, 119 (Cadet Bentinck on
this occasion carried his bat through the innings for 38,
Captain Bainbridge making 37).</p>

<p>May 24.&mdash;<i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> Mr. Denison&rsquo;s Eleven:</p>

<p>Mr. Denison&rsquo;s Eleven, 106; <i>Britannia</i>, 156 (Lieut. Thomas
scored 95 not out).</p>

<p>On the Queen&rsquo;s birthday &ldquo;whole&rdquo; there was a very close
and exciting match against the Royal Naval College.</p>

<p>The College score was not a formidable one to face; but
when the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; was out for 15 there was considerable anxiety.
Lieut. Thomas, however, the other great &ldquo;stand by,&rdquo; was still
to go in. When he was bowled for 13 there was consternation
indeed. The College team were generous in the matters
of extras, however, and the hundred went up amid shouts of
applause, a glorious match being brought to a triumphant
conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
May 31st, <i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> Plymouth Garrison:</p>

<p>Garrison, 65 (Captain Quill, 46); <i>Britannia</i>, 257 for seven
wickets (Bentinck, 73, Lieut. Thomas, 62).</p>

<p>This was a great victory, as a Garrison team is usually
pretty strong.</p>

<p>In addition to &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; matches, of which there was a
full programme every season, a great deal of ingenuity was
exercised in organising both cricket and football contests
among the cadets: Port Watch <i>v.</i> Starboard; the Admirers
of Cambridge <i>v.</i> Oxford; Over 5 ft. <i>v.</i> Under 5 ft.; Odd
Classes <i>v.</i> Even Classes; <i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Hindostan</i>; to say
nothing of the various matches between the terms.</p>

<p>No &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; football matches appear in the earlier
numbers of the magazine, but a regular programme was
instituted later on.</p>

<p>In a match on November 11th, 1884, Over 5 ft. <i>v.</i> Under
5 ft., the game was considered by the &ldquo;cognoscenti&rdquo; to be
a hollow affair for the Overs. These heroes, however,
received a lesson as to the folly of holding a foe too cheaply;
for the Unders won by 7 goals to 0! The Overs, no
doubt, got well chaffed about it; and the smaller boys must
have played a very good game to win so easily.</p>

<p>Cambridge twice beat Oxford; the Third Term beat
their seniors, the Fourth, by one &ldquo;corner&rdquo; only; while the
Second Term beat the &ldquo;News&rdquo; by 6 goals to 1.</p>

<p>In the first match, Odd Classes <i>v.</i> Even, the Odds won by
2 goals and 1 &ldquo;corner&rdquo;; but the Evens turned the tables
at the return match, winning by 11 goals 2 &ldquo;corners&rdquo; to
2 goals. (It is said that a cadet made some wretched jokes
on this occasion; remarking that though the odds were
against the Evens, they played even better than the Odds; that
it was odd that they had not got even with them before, and
so on. There is no saying what intricacies he might not
have got entangled in, had not some of his comrades mercifully
rolled him down a steep slope and sat on him; while a
lieutenant who was told of it spoke darkly of &ldquo;three days
two&rdquo; if he didn&rsquo;t drop it. Sensitive minds cannot stand much
of this sort of thing!)</p>

In 1884 the cricketing prospects were decidedly improved
by the appointment of Mr. E.&nbsp;M. Tims, naval instructor, who
has been there ever since, and is now chief. For many years
he was a tower of strength to the eleven; but has now
relinquished cricket, and is resting on his laurels, and urging
on his juniors to further victories.</p>

<p>The cricket season of 1885 opened well, <i>Britannia</i> again
beating Plymouth Garrison on May 6th; while a week later
they scored a tremendous victory over Plymouth Cricket
Club.</p>

<p><i>Britannia</i>, 299; Underwood &ldquo;came off&rdquo; to admiration,
scoring 156; he and Lieut. Thomas contributed 206 between
them; moreover, there was quite a record in extras&mdash;no less
than 31. Plymouth went in against this formidable total, and
only succeeded in obtaining 87.</p>

<p>May 16th, <i>Britannia</i> <i>v.</i> Torquay:</p>

<p><i>Britannia</i>, 153 (Mr. Tims 40, Lieut. Thomas 32); Torquay,
54; a very solid victory. But nemesis ensued, for on June
14th Torquay made 167 against <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> 37; they brought
on a deadly fast bowler, who wrought havoc in the &ldquo;timber
yard,&rdquo; and established a funk, taking six wickets for 12 runs.</p>

<p>June 17th. <i>Britannia</i> played the Royal Marines, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
can usually get a good team together; however, <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i>
star was again in the ascendant, their side scoring 184 (Underwood
55, Lieut. Thomas 32), against the Royal Marines&rsquo; 117.</p>

<p>Lieut. Thomas got out in rather a curious fashion: he had
a man to run for him, and, being non-striker, was out &ldquo;in the
country&rdquo; near the umpire. The striker drove a ball back
hard along the ground; it was diverted by a fieldsman (who
made a grab at it) and hit the opposite wicket; the &ldquo;runner&rdquo;
was out of his ground, of course. It is an extraordinary thing
that if you have a man to run for you, you are almost certain
to be run out. He may have the very best intentions, and be
a perfect sprinter between the wickets; no matter, he is sure
to be out of his ground when the wicket goes down.</p>

<p>In a match against the Engineer students in July, 1885,
each played rather a remarkable innings. <i>Britannia</i> went in
first, and only scored 80, of which the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; made just three-fourths,
leaving an average of two runs apiece among the
remainder of the eleven. The Engineers, however, were not
going to be out-classed in the matter of eccentricities; they
scored 40 for two wickets, and were all out for 60!</p>

<p>Matches in the season of 1885 resulted as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Played, 17: Won 11, lost 2, drawn 4.</p>

<p>This is a good record, and by no means the only one of
the kind, as will be seen.</p>


<p class="break">We must, however, leave the achievements of the
cricketers and the football teams for a little while, in order to
notice some of the other competitions, which it has been
considered advisable to include under the heading of &ldquo;Games.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has been customary for a long time past to hold meetings
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The cadets&rsquo; regatta takes place in the autumn on a
Wednesday or Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Sailing matches are also held between the sailing cutters&mdash;third
and fourth term cadets only&mdash;in each term, in
heats, as opportunity offers.</p>

<p>Athletic sports take place in the cricket field on a
Wednesday or Saturday afternoon before the Easter vacation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
An assault-at-arms is held in July and December.</p>

<p>A tennis tournament is held in the autumn term, and a
racquet tournament in the summer term.</p>

<p>A swimming competition takes place at the end of the
summer term.</p>

<p>Prizes are given for cricket: one for the best batting
average, and one for bowling.</p>

<p>The beagle whips each receive a prize when passing out.</p>

<p>This is a goodly list; and a keen interest is taken in all,
both by officers and cadets.</p>

<p>The regatta consists of pulling races only; the most
important contest being that between representatives of the
port and starboard watches, in twelve-oared cutters, for a silver
cup, which is placed, after the regatta, on the port or starboard
side of the messroom, according to the winning watch,
and the other watch tries to shift it over next time. It
changes hands with considerably greater frequency than the
America Cup!</p>

<p>The other events in the regatta are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Four-oared gigs (a race in each term).</p>

<p>Pair oars, with coxswains.</p>

<p>Single sculls.</p>

<p>Four-oared gigs for study classes, each crew being distinguished
by the name of a master.</p>

<p>In connection with the single sculls there is a curious and
unusual trophy, known as &ldquo;The Rushworth Seal.&rdquo; This is an
old-fashioned gold seal, presented by the father of Mr. C.&nbsp;E.
Rushworth, midshipman, who lost his life in a gallant attempt
to save that of a seaman who fell overboard from H.M.S.
<i>Agincourt</i>, in the Levant, in 1877. It is kept in the messroom,
in a glass case, with a small model of a ship&rsquo;s cutter,
and is held by the winner of the single sculls for one year,
thus serving to &ldquo;keep green&rdquo; the memory of the youthful
hero, and stimulate others to do likewise.</p>

<p>The regatta has usually been an occasion upon which
numerous guests are invited on board to witness the prowess
of the cadets with the oar, and also to enjoy a little harmless
recreation in the shape of dancing. The editor of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
<i>Britannia Magazine</i> evidently considers that there is too
little looking on and too much dissipation in the way
of dancing and attending to fair guests.</p>

<p>The regatta of 1886 was held on a very bad day, the rain
coming down heavily towards the end. The editorial remarks
are a little bitter:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hoped that the next time the officers will have an
opportunity of seeing some of the races, as they are naturally
interested in the performances of the cadets. As at present
arranged, we think that their hospitality to their many
visitors must make them utterly unable to see a single race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dancers had been driven by stress of weather from the
poop to the middle deck, and were enjoying &lsquo;Sir Roger&rsquo;
when the drowned rats appeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It does appear to be somewhat of an incongruity that the
cadets should row races in pouring rain without the satisfaction
of having their officers and the visitors in the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo;;
but the editor does not see any improvement next year, and
is down upon them savagely.</p>

<p>After referring in a somewhat caustic vein to the inevitable
notice, &ldquo;If Wednesday be wet, the regatta will be postponed
until Saturday,&rdquo; and the folly of holding a regatta on equinox
day, he proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us for the future have the cadets&rsquo; regatta on August
12th, and then we shall have no doubt about it. There need
be no cadets here: that will make little difference. A few
blue boats can be set to row up and down, with crews from
the shore, hired for the occasion. The officers of the ship will
entertain the fair ones from the neighbourhood under a
blazing sky, and the only difficulty will arise at the end, when
the finish of the races usually brings an accession of strength
to the dancing men, and ladies who have been without
partners for too many dances find that the opportunity of
a valse with a sailor, which they have looked forward to all
the year, has failed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not well to be cynical (!), but to row in hailstorms,
and to make sport for spectators who do not look on, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"><!-- original location of full page illustration --></a></span>

soured our feelings, and we have only to look forward to
our next regatta with hopes of better things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the editorial sledge-hammer with a vengeance,
even the ladies who love to dance with sailors are not spared.
The note of exclamation above is <em>not</em> the editor&rsquo;s; it is merely
inserted as an outlet for the feelings of the reader of this
extract.</p>

<p>The athletic sports include the following events:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mile handicap.<br />
Half-mile handicap (sometimes).<br />
Quarter-mile handicap.<br />
100 yards handicap.<br />
Hurdle race.<br />
Sack race.<br />
Obstacle race (sometimes).<br />
High jump.<br />
Long jump.<br />
Pole jump.<br />
Throwing the cricket-ball.<br />
Tug of war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of the events are duplicated as &ldquo;open,&rdquo; or &ldquo;under
five feet,&rdquo; so the programme is a long one.</p>

<p>In 1886 the open quarter-mile was run in 62 seconds, and
the 100 yards in very good time. The editor of the <i>Britannia
Magazine</i> says, however: &ldquo;The 100 yards was won by Cadet
Field, two others being almost neck and neck; the timekeeper
was so excited that he gave the time as 10 seconds,
which we have reason for doubting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It certainly seems a remarkable feat for lads like these,
who do not presumably go in for very extensive training.</p>

<p>The high jump was 4 ft. 3&frac34; inches, which is not remarkable;
and the long jump 15 ft. 2 ins.</p>

<p>Cadet Kennedy won the pole jump with 7 ft. 1 in., which
is distinctly good; and the half-mile was won in 2 mins.
35 secs., Cadet Field, the winner of the 100 yards, who was
scratch, just failing to carry it off.</p>

<p>The following curious editorial comment appears in
reference to the long jump:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sharp, jumping very well, won easily: Foord was second,
a foot behind him. Williams would have won had he
jumped further.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There may be some sporting signification in this otherwise
somewhat glaringly obvious statement; on the other hand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
the editor, who found it necessary at times to be severe, may
have been relaxing himself a little.</p>

<p>In the cricket season of 1886 nineteen matches were
played, with results:</p>

<p>Won, 8; lost, 6; drawn, 5.</p>

<p>Not as good as 1885, but the season was remarkable for
the tremendous average obtained by the professional: 100&middot;9
for 18 innings; the next to him was 15&middot;8! He made 174 not
out against the Navy at Plymouth; <i>Britannia</i> scoring no less
than 337 for 5 wickets, against their opponents&rsquo; 83.</p>

<p>In 1887, which was a remarkably fine summer, nearly
every match came off, returns being played in several
instances.</p>

<p>Underwood again showed great form, but he failed in
the first match, against the Royal Marines; the cadets
pulled off the match, however, scoring 68 against 53. These
are small scores for such redoubtable teams, and the Marines
determined that theirs, at least, should be larger in the return
match, in which they reversed the former decision, scoring
197 to <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> 81. This was largely due to the fine batting
of Lieut. Rait, R.M.L.I., who took out his bat for 119.</p>

Teignbridge are always dangerous opponents, and though
the close of their innings was decidedly of a processional
character, Sim won easily off his own bat. It will be noticed
that Underwood and Mr. Tims made 54 for <i>Britannia</i>, the
rest nowhere!</p>

<p>On the return, on July 6th, Teignbridge brought an almost
totally different team; perhaps they discounted their adversaries
too freely, but it may have been as good an eleven or
better. At any rate <i>Britannia</i> administered a good beating:&mdash;</p>

<p>The second eleven played some matches, and came off
successfully.</p>

<p>Result of the season in 1887:&mdash;</p>

<p>Played, 21: Won, 10; lost, 7; drawn, 4.</p>

<p>The season of 1888 was remarkably successful:&mdash;</p>

<p>Played, 17: Won, 12; lost, 1; drawn, 4.</p>

<p>There are not many schools that lose only one match out
of seventeen in a season. For some reason, there are no
scores inserted in the <i>Britannia Magazine</i> for this season;
it is mentioned that Captain Bedford rendered good service
with the bat on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>In 1889 there is again a lack of material for comment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
the cricket number for this year having unfortunately been
lost.</p>

<p>One very important event, however, has to be recorded.</p>

<p>On July 17th and 18th a two-day match was arranged
against M.C.C. and Ground, and the team was captained by
no less a person than &ldquo;W.&nbsp;G.&rdquo; himself. Unfortunately, he
could not come down for the first day&rsquo;s play; but let Mr.
Grace speak for himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="signature"><i>15th September, 1903.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Captain Statham</span>,&mdash;In answer to your inquiries <i>re</i> my visit
to the <i>Britannia</i> in 1889. My son, H.&nbsp;E. Grace, was not then on the
<i>Britannia</i>, as he did not join until January, 1890. It was through
Lieutenant Abdy, who had played with me at Lord&rsquo;s, that I promised
to play. Gloucestershire were playing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia
at Bristol on the first day, and it was arranged that I should get down
for the second day if I could not go for the first. As the match at
Bristol was not over, I did not get to Dartmouth until late in the
evening of the first day&rsquo;s play. My friend Abdy was just leaving the
<i>Britannia</i>, as he had been ordered off to the man&oelig;uvres, so took no
part in the second day&rsquo;s cricket. Lieutenant de Robeck was deputed
to look after me, which I need not say he did right well. You will see
by the enclosed score that I was absent the first innings. After the
match was over another was started, in which I took part. It ended in
a draw. I remember the best form was shown by Abdy, de Robeck,
Taylor, and Royds. Underwood, the professional coach, took the
greatest interest in the cadets&rsquo; cricket, and did wonders for them,
considering he had only had them under his charge for two years. I
am sorry I do not recollect more details, but to go back fourteen years
is a long time.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="padright">Believe me, yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">W.&nbsp;G. Grace.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As will be seen by the score, <i>Britannia</i> had to follow on,
scoring only 61 against 156. They did better in their &ldquo;second
venture&rdquo; (as the &ldquo;daily&rdquo; cricket reporter hath it), but M.C.C.
won easily by seven wickets.</p>

<p>In the second match M.C.C. went in first and declared at
118 for two wickets. &ldquo;W.&nbsp;G.&rdquo; made 48 before he was bowled
by Mr. Taylor, hitting out of the ground several times:
Chatterton, not out 57.</p>

<p><i>Britannia</i> made 82 for nine wickets before time was
called; Mr. Grace took seven of them.</p>

<p>In a local account of the match the reporter remarks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
ironically that the &ldquo;cadets <em>fielded</em> very well,&rdquo; which scarcely
does the <i>Britannia</i> justice. Their second innings was not at
all a bad performance against the bowling of Mycroft, Chatterton,
and Grace, all of whom were accustomed to getting their
share of wickets in first-class cricket.</p>

<p>Among other matches played during this season, there is
a phenomenal one against Torquay, in which <i>Britannia</i> made
over 200, and got Torquay out for 20. <i>Britannia</i> also beat
Teignbridge by 89, and Plymouth by 157.</p>

<p>The editor gives some fatherly advice to cricket aspirants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The practice at the nets is not all that it should be;
instead of trying to play with care and learning to defend
the wicket, by far the greater number of cadets seem to think
it is a good opportunity for a slog. By all means play the ball
hard, but it is the ruin of any boy&rsquo;s cricket when once he
begins to slog at everything in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bowlers are admonished for trying to bowl too fast
and not keeping a good length; the fielding is &ldquo;damned with
faint praise,&rdquo; and finally certain cadets &ldquo;who take a delight
in playing the fool&rdquo; at the nets are recommended, in good
plain English, to stay away. Very good advice: let us take
our cricket seriously, by all means.</p>

<p>The regatta of 1890 came off with great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&eacute;clat</i>; and as
the editor has no disparaging remarks to make about the
&ldquo;gallery,&rdquo; it may be concluded that his gentle insinuations
on former occasions have produced the desired effect. There
was a very close race for the Rushworth Seal in the single
sculls, Cadet Prentis just pulling it off, probably because
he was a trifle fresher than Withers, who unshipped a
scull close to the finish, which is always likely to happen
when a pumped-out sculler spurts; and though he recovered
pluckily, it lost him the match.</p>

<p>Some &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; football matches are on record in the
season 1890-91.</p>

<p>Rugby.</p>

<p>Blundell&rsquo;s School, Tiverton, <i>Britannia</i> lost by 5 points.</p>

<p>Royal Naval Engineers&rsquo; College, a similar result.</p>

<p>Exeter Grammar School, <i>Britannia</i> lost by 3 goals to 1.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
Association was more successful:&mdash;</p>

<p>Against Paignton School, <i>Britannia</i> won, 5 goals to 1.</p>

<p>Return match, <i>Britannia</i> won 5 goals to 0.</p>

<p>Mannamead School won by 2 goals to 1.</p>

<p>The match with Plymouth was a draw.</p>

<p>Totnes Grammar School won by 5 goals to 0.</p>

<p>In the match against Torbay Football Club, as they
were a heavier team than schoolboys, Lieutenant de Robeck
and Dr. South played; and after an exciting game, <i>Britannia</i>
won by 1 goal to 0.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Newcomer&rdquo;&mdash;evidently an executive officer who had
passed the <i>Britannia</i> in his youth&mdash;takes occasion to remark
upon the vast improvement in the cricket of the cadets,
and attributes this to the careful coaching of the professional.
He says&mdash;&ldquo;The form and confidence displayed now is quite
different from that of twelve years ago. The bowling is much
improved, but it is a bit wild at times, from the very mistaken
idea of trying to bowl too fast, which is always prevalent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
among boys so young. The fielding is also very good, and
quite up to the form of any of the public schools, who do not
have such a difficult piece of ground to perform on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The year 1893, as many will remember, was remarkable
for its long dry summer; indeed, the summer appeared to
commence in April, and went right through to September,
so that most cricket grounds&mdash;the <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> included&mdash;were
any colour you like except green.</p>

<p>It was naturally a season for batsmen, and <i>Britannia</i>
made some long scores.</p>

<p>Against Exeter Grammar School they declared at 249
for 3 wickets; their opponents were perhaps tired by their
leather-hunting, for they did not avail themselves of run-getting
weather, being all out for 49. Mannamead School
and Plymouth Cricket Club were also handsomely beaten,
while South Devon, against <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> 186 for 7 wickets,
scored 116 for 9, and just managed to keep their end up
until time was called: a moral victory for <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>The second eleven won nearly all their matches: Paignton
School were beaten by 203 to 74, and Montpelier School by
146 (for 7 wickets) to 32.</p>

<p>Cadets Begg and Backhouse had each a creditable bowling
analysis, the former getting 26, and the latter 34 wickets
for an average of under eight runs each.</p>

<p>The editor has something to say about following the
beagles:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must review the beagling season up to date (Christmas,
1893). As far as sport goes it has been satisfactory,
but as far as the attendance of the cadets goes it has not.
Now, why is this? We have heard that beagling is considered
by some of the senior boys to be &lsquo;bad form.&rsquo; Now,
we ask you cadets who are sportsmen, are you to be choked
off your sport because some big or senior boy&mdash;who may
play football only, or is more probably a loafer, bred in a
town with no knowledge of sport, poor chap&mdash;says, &lsquo;Feign I
beagling,&rsquo; or something of the sort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There appears to have been a sort of wave of slackness
passing through the ship about that time, at least in regard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
to the winter games; but some brilliant work was done at
cricket when the summer came round again&mdash;the last season
in which the <i>Britannia</i> boys were to have the advantage
of Underwood&rsquo;s coaching.</p>

<p><i>Britannia</i> (without the professional) declared at 173 for
<em>one</em> wicket against Paignton, and got them out for 120.
Against the Royal Marines&mdash;also without the professional&mdash;they
had even more &ldquo;up their sleeve,&rdquo; for they made 274
against 68.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">

<p class="caption">A &ldquo;BRITANNIA&rdquo; RUGBY TEAM.<br />
<i>Photo: Smale &amp; Son, Dartmouth.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant de Robeck made some big scores&mdash;114 against
the Royal Marines, and 109, not out, against Newton Blues,
a very strong team.</p>

<p>Matches, 1894: Won, 6; lost, 5; drawn, 5.</p>

<p>Some maxims of Lord Harris are here inserted in the
magazine, for the benefit of the &ldquo;young ideas&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, when you are at the wicket, go through a variety
of attitudes to show how you could play an imaginary pitched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
up or short ball, but be content with playing it correctly
when it is bowled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, when you have been bowled out, say it was the
worst ball ever bowled; it detracts from your own merits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, when you miss a catch, think to gain the sympathy
of the audience by tearing your hair or grovelling in the
dust; save another run by throwing the ball in as quickly
as possible, and abase yourself in your own estimation as
much as you please afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is Lord Harris also who gives the advice: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, when
you give a chance off your glove, rub your elbow: it is not
good form, and will not deceive an efficient umpire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With regard to the second paragraph quoted above, the
crack bat of a very good club, who was addicted to finding
some special reason for getting out, varied it on one occasion,
when a &ldquo;bailer&rdquo; had him first ball. He put on a judicially
satisfied air, and remarked in a loud and cheerful voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not a bit ashamed! It was a splendid ball; might have
bowled anyone: not a bit ashamed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1895 no fewer than 22 first eleven matches were
played, with the following results:</p>

<p>Won, 13; lost, 7; drawn, 2 (both in <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> favour).</p>

<p>The second eleven won 13 and lost 4; and the third
eleven, playing &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; matches for the first time, won
3 and lost 1.</p>

<p>A great season this; certainly no school could hope to
display greater keenness about cricket, and few would attain
such a measure of success.</p>

<p>There was a great match against Mannamead School, in
which only cadets played, on June 12th.</p>

<p>A fine example of even scoring&mdash;three in the forties and
two in the thirties.</p>

<p>The hero of &ldquo;cock&rsquo;s score,&rdquo; Cadet Bedwell, does not appear
to have been put on to bowl, or, at any rate, he achieved no
success; but in the following effusion he seems to be selected
for distinction&mdash;perhaps in irony, being more of a bat than a
bowler.</p>

<p>It is one of several which are contributed by a gifted
correspondent of the <i>Britannia Magazine</i>, each in the style
of a well-known poet; they are very clever imitations, and
probably the author is not a cadet, though there is no saying,
of course. It is scarcely necessary to name the poet whose
style is here adopted:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So all day long the cricket ball was bowled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the wooded heights by western seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> champions one by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fallen, hopeful, though the side was out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For only ninety. Then, because the score was small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captain put on Bedivel to bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And charged him thus: &ldquo;Take this our trusty ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fling it straight into the middle stump;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let the scorer watch with anxious care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See what thou doest, and deftly note it down.&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then forth he fared, the bowler Bedivel&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him Bold Sir Bedivel his comrades called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when they dubbed him Bedivel the bowled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed in white flannel, solid, muscular,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And taking careful aim, he hurled the ball.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The batsman&rsquo;s eyes were dazzled at the sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dallied long, dividing his slow mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In act to swipe. But at last it seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better to block it and to save his stumps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo! too late: the yorker hit its mark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spake the captain to Sir Bedivel:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Hast thou performed the order that I gave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is it thou hast seen? What hast thou done?&rdquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answer made the bowler Bedivel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I hurled the ball forth, aiming near the crease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the leg-stump prostrate on the ground.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is an excellent piece of fooling, whoever wrote it, and
should immortalise not only the writer, but Sir Bedivel also.
There is a footnote appended in the original: &ldquo;Probably the
same who was afterwards called Bedivere,&rdquo; which leaves a
comical sort of uncertainty which way the anachronism works.</p>

<p>The cricket season of 1896 was marked by two remarkable
performances of the third eleven, against Totnes School.</p>

<p>In the first match <i>Britannia</i> made 309, and won by an
innings and 225 runs; in the return they made 405, winning
by an innings and 220. This is what may be termed &ldquo;making
a holy show&rdquo; of Totnes; and it argues also a very widely
spread proficiency among the cadets, for, even paying both
sides the poor compliment of assuming that Totnes were
weak, an innings of 405 under any circumstances argues a
capacity for batting which is most unusual in a school third
eleven.</p>

<p>The first eleven played their two old rivals&mdash;Plymouth
College and Mannamead School&mdash;amalgamated into one
establishment; only cadets took part in the match, and they
declared at 266 for six wickets, dismissing their opponents
for 117.</p>

<p>The season&rsquo;s record is an exemplary one:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First eleven.&mdash;Won, 11; lost, 3; drawn, 2.<br />
Second eleven.&mdash;Won, 11; lost, 4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <i>Britannia</i> games are never permitted to stand still&mdash;there
is no such thing as finality recognised.</p>

<p>In 1893 a regular series of football matches was in full
swing, both Rugby and Association being played.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Soccer&rdquo; team won four out of five matches.</p>

Twenty-five goals were thus scored for <i>Britannia</i>, and only
nine against, which is an instructive method of regarding a
football season.</p>

<p>At the regatta of 1896 a new event was introduced&mdash;<i>Hindostan</i>
<i>v.</i> <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;two pinnaces competing, each
crammed with cadets. This is a regular piece of marine
buffoonery; of course, the oars are very much handicapped
by the crowd, but, nevertheless, two or three hands manage to
get hold of each oar, while the remainder make as much noise
as possible. <i>Britannia</i> won, amid shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>The list of times, etc., in the various athletic competitions,
extending over nearly 20 years, as set forth in the accompanying
table, is very interesting. The mile record of
5 min. 8 sec. is discredited; but it was, undoubtedly, done in
5 min. 9&frac12; sec. by Cadet Ward, in 1901, so perhaps the hero
of 1893 has been wrongly deprived of his place. It is certainly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
astonishingly good time for a boy, if correct, the pace being
nearly 11&frac34; miles an hour. In view of the doubt&mdash;possibly
attributable, as on a former occasion, to the unduly excited
condition of the timekeeper&mdash;the alternative record is held by
Cadet Huddart, who subsequently won laurels on a sterner
field, but did not, alas! survive to wear them. He was a midshipman
in the Naval Brigade attached to Lord Methuen&rsquo;s
force, and in the assault at Graspan, leading his men under
the deadly fire, he was hit repeatedly, but refused to fall out,
until a mortal wound laid him low.</p>

<p>The Association team has been uniformly more successful
than Rugby; the following remarks of the editor on the
subject of Rugby football appear to point to a possible
explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most important item in football is &lsquo;stodge.&rsquo; I have
actually seen a fellow come out of the canteen to play a
match&mdash;a <em>match</em>, mind you&mdash;with his mouth full of jam, or
some mess or other. He wonders, after a time, why he is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
bit off colour; thinks it&rsquo;s the weather, or his boots. Mind, no
stodge till the game is over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One might adopt the language of the sinister Custom
House officer in &ldquo;The Smuggler&rsquo;s Leap&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your words are plain, though they&rsquo;re somewhat rough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marvel is that boys so frequently play a good game
at &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; or make a long score at cricket, in spite of
&ldquo;stodge,&rdquo; and that of the most wind-destroying character:
they are, presumably, specially constructed in the interior at
that age.</p>

<p>At Christmas, 1897, it is reported that Mrs. Curzon-Howe,
the captain&rsquo;s wife, presented a couple and a half of beagles to
the pack, which then amounted to 17&frac12; couples, with some
puppies coming on. The beagles started a fox on one occasion,
and ran it for nearly two hours. The distance is stated
to have been fourteen miles; there is no mention of the
number of &ldquo;footmen&rdquo; who kept with the hounds, but it
must have been rather hot for them.</p>

<p>A new feature in 1897 was the introduction of hockey
matches: Cadet Captains <i>v.</i> Ship; Officers <i>v.</i> Ship; <i>Britannia</i>
<i>v.</i> <i>Hindostan</i>.</p>

<p>There is an assault-at-arms twice in the year&mdash;in July and
December; the summer meeting is held in the fields, and
great enthusiasm prevails.</p>

<p>Competitions take place at the horizontal bar, parallel
bars, and other gymnastics, properly so called, including the
&ldquo;human pyramid&rdquo;; a display with dumb bells; poles,
etc.; and contests with gloves and fencing swords, which, of
course, are by far the most popular, both with cadets and
spectators.</p>

<p>The boys get a good grounding in the essential points of
fencing and boxing, but to attain to any great degree of proficiency
in either requires a good deal more time than can
conveniently be devoted to it, and the boxing frequently has
a strong spice of the &ldquo;hammer and tongs&rdquo; business about it.
Still, there are some who shape very well; and, at any rate, a
few systematic lessons will enable a lad to do something more
than assume, like Mr. Pickwick, &ldquo;a paralytic attitude,&rdquo; which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
his friends confidently believed to be intended for a posture
of defence.</p>

<p>Cricket continues to flourish, and a season in which
<i>Britannia</i> should fail to win a majority of matches would be
regarded as a sort of hideous dream. The editor of the
<i>Britannia Magazine</i> would either pass it over in silence or
dip his pen in gall and administer such a rating as would, in
his editorial opinion, infallibly bring about a different result
in the ensuing year; followed, no doubt, by a mild protest
against cynicism!</p>

A very exciting match was played, in 1902, against Stratford-on-Avon
Wanderers; Lord is the <i>Britannia</i> professional,
a left-hander, and an artful dodger in the matter of an unexpected
&ldquo;break back.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> score was 101 at the fall of the eighth wicket;
Cadet Whetham was bowled first ball&mdash;six runs still wanted
when Glasgow came in. He had taken six wickets, and now
he came to the rescue with the bat, and he and Mr. Royse,
the chaplain, won the match by steady play at a critical
moment.</p>

<p>To a lover of beautiful scenery and keen cricket, it would
be difficult to find a more attractive spot than the <i>Britannia</i>
cricket grounds on a fine half holiday. For the benefit of
readers who have not enjoyed the privilege of being present
on such an occasion, let us pay a visit in spirit to the
<i>Britannia</i> on a certain Saturday during the summer of 1903;
a perfect day, which would have been too hot but for a light
westerly breeze with never a touch of chill in it.</p>

<p>The cadets&rsquo; dinner is at noon on Saturday, and by 1.30
there is scarcely a boy left on board the ship. Some are away
in boats or sailing cutters, some are off for a walk, others to
visit friends in the neighbourhood, and so on; but we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
follow the large contingent which makes its way to the cricket
grounds. Landing at the solid stone pier abreast the ship, we
cross the asphalt tennis courts, and mount the concrete steps
in the far right-hand corner. There are many of these steps,
intercepted by level landings, and winding up the hillside
past the racquet courts, all overshadowed by trees, which lend
a welcome shade, but do not prevent one getting pretty hot
during the ascent. At length the last flight is surmounted,
and a broad, well-kept path, still under trees, leads on past
the beagle kennels, where a loud and inquisitive chorus greets
a stranger, to the lower ground. Play is already in progress,
so we dutifully keep to the right behind the white screen, and
passing across the end of the cricket ground, mount to the
upper ground, which is separated from the lower one by a
steep grassy bank some 12 or 15 feet high, with several flights
of stone steps. Here, standing by the edge of the bank, you
can see both grounds to advantage. On the far side is the
pavilion, a long bungalow, with an elevated scoring-box in the
centre; and here are spacious dressing-rooms, a canteen, where
excellent &ldquo;stodge&rdquo; may be obtained at the most moderate
charges, and a large amount of sitting accommodation for
onlookers. A large tent to the left contains tea and refreshments
for the officers and their friends. The view is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
magnificent in every direction, and the full benefit of the summer
breeze is felt at this elevation.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is a great deal of cricket going on;
the first and third elevens are playing matches on the
lower, and the second eleven on the upper ground; and
there is plenty of room for a couple of picked sides to play
in addition.</p>

<p>Anticipating a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon in such
surroundings, we take up a commanding position on a seat
overlooking the first eleven pitch.</p>

<p>The match is against Teignbridge, who always play a
strong team, including several county players; so <i>Britannia</i>
naturally does all she knows, and her eleven only contains
two cadets, while the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; is included as a matter of course.
The remaining eight comprises two lieutenants, two Engineer
lieutenants, the paymaster, the science master&mdash;whose science
is not confined to the lecture room&mdash;the chaplain, and one
of the doctors.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; have first knock, and are not doing as
well as their strength would lead one to expect. Already
several wickets are down, and the score is small. The
deliveries of Lord, the professional, and Mr. Warner, the
science master, are evidently too much for the batsmen. The
fielding, moreover, is very keen; quite up to the mark.</p>

<p>The boundaries are liberal, especially on the north and
north-east; indeed, the former looks well worth five
runs.</p>

<p>There goes their crack player! Bowled by Lord for a
&ldquo;duck.&rdquo; This is an extremely good riddance, for he is a
doughty bat; a left hander, with a strong defence, and a
dangerous capacity for scoring if he once gets set.</p>

<p>Two more wickets in rapid succession, both to the science
master; and the end comes with surprising rapidity.</p>

<p>The first lieutenant, his many-coloured blazer showing up
to advantage in the strong sunlight, comes along with a
joyous countenance. &ldquo;Lucky! got &rsquo;em out for 59; strong
team, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very lucky: and not all luck, either. Being, of course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
strong partisans of <i>Britannia</i>, we rejoice with him, and hope
his side will be in form with the bat.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; is mustering rapidly. Nearly all the officers
of the ship are on the ground; the captain strolls up, with
two or three children and a happy dog; officers&rsquo; wives, and
outside friends, make a goodly show on the seats along the
terrace, half-way down the bank.</p>

<p>Time for <i>Britannia</i> to go in, and Engineer Lieutenants
Benn and Smith are deputed to open the ball. Athletics, as
is well known, are by no means neglected at the Engineers&rsquo;
Training College; and these two gentlemen, whose duty it
is to look after the engines of the tenders attached to the
<i>Britannia</i>, and initiate the cadets into the mysteries of steam,
are well able also to show them a wrinkle or two in handling
the willow.</p>

<p>The bowling starts well. Looking at the pitch, in nautical
parlance, &ldquo;broadside on,&rdquo; one is able to see what a good length
the left hander keeps: shoots unpleasantly, too, at times, so
that you have to be wide awake to get down on them.</p>

<p>These two are bad men to bowl at, though; they &ldquo;keep
their hair on,&rdquo; watching the ball keenly, and contenting themselves
at first with a snick or two through the slips, or a
&ldquo;pull&rdquo; of moderate dimensions. But the left hander is
beginning to lose his length a little, and pitches them up;
so the batsmen may get a chance of &ldquo;opening their
shoulders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Benn faces him for a fresh over. Ah! there is
one well pitched up: he won&rsquo;t let that off! Not he: a lovely
off-drive, going at a tremendous pace, all along the ground,
just outside mid-off, who makes a wild grab, but fails to
reach it. Away it goes, the man behind the bowler tearing
after it, without the remotest chance of catching it, until the
little dark speck disappears from view over the gentle slope
on the northern boundary. Really now, anyone, &ldquo;W.&nbsp;G.&rdquo; or
&ldquo;C.&nbsp;B.&rdquo; included, might be proud of that drive: and there are
several more of the same kind to follow, though the foe
discounts them by putting a man there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Smith is not idle; he is not as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
fierce a driver as his companion, but his wrist play through
the slips is delightfully clean and well timed.</p>

<p>The opponents&rsquo; score is passed long since, and still no
wicket. Ah! there is one at last. Lieutenant Benn is caught,
for an innings of 69, thoroughly well played: and the score is
117 for one wicket; very good business!</p>

<p>Lieutenant de Burgh, of whom great things are usually
expected, is bowled by a shooter from the left hander; Lieutenant
Smith is caught for a capital innings of 46; Cadets
Sparling and Beal show nice form with the bat, the latter
scoring 17; then Dr. Bobardt and the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; get together
and play out time. The doctor is a left hander, and smites
very hard when he gets his opportunity; mid-on has occasion
to wring his fingers and inspect them dubiously more than
once, testifying mutely to the vigour of the doctor&rsquo;s drives&mdash;or,
possibly, not mutely; but his remarks are not audible to
the gallery.</p>

<p>Total, for six wickets, 214; and of course, being a one day
match, it was in reality a victory by ten wickets, Dr. Bobardt
and Lord taking out their bats for 47 and 20 respectively.</p>

<p>And what about the second eleven? They are playing
Montpelier School; Lieutenant Chetwode plays with them,
as a set off against the master on the other side, who is
a very big man and a very keen cricketer.</p>

<p><i>Britannia</i> bats first, and does very creditably: Powell 49,
Cull 44, Ling 25, Nicholson 22, and no ducks; &ldquo;extras&rdquo;
comes out with an unusually long score, 22; total, 221.
Towards the end of the innings Montpelier&rsquo;s bowling was very
slack, and Cadet Powell displayed good capacity for availing
himself of it, repeatedly getting boundaries away to the bank
under the trees on the west side; big leg hits, well timed.</p>

<p>The School would have come off badly, indeed, without
their master, who went in first wicket down and scored 91;
no one was able to keep him company very long, and it
looked like a certain victory for <i>Britannia</i> when the ninth
wicket fell with some time to spare. However, the last two
men kept their ends up, and the result was a draw, greatly in
<i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> favour, the School score having only reached 168.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
The third eleven had a similar experience against King
Edward School, but the &ldquo;morality&rdquo; of the victory was much
more pronounced, <i>Britannia</i> scoring 283 to their opponents&rsquo;
60 for nine wickets; obviously, a declaration at 200 or so
would have been sounder tactics.</p>

<p>Cadet Scott scored in this match 104; and he and Cadet
Alexander did some remarkable scoring together, actually
compiling 103 runs off the first nine overs! An average of
over 11 runs an over; rather demoralising for the bowlers!</p>

<p>Well, this delightful afternoon is over, all too soon;
&ldquo;time&rdquo; is called all round, and soon there is a general exodus
from the fields, cadets and officers streaming off in groups
down the steps, discussing the play in enthusiastic fashion;
and so off to the ship, happy and hungry, in spite of the
&ldquo;stodge&rdquo; in the pavilion.</p>

<p>During a first eleven match this season a curious misunderstanding
occurred. It was a &ldquo;full strength&rdquo; game, and
<i>Britannia</i>, going in first, scored freely, declaring at 244 for
eight wickets. There was time to dispose of the other side,
with good luck, but not too much; and of course their policy
was to play for a draw.</p>

<p>However, they began to go out pretty fast towards the
close, and with about a quarter of an hour left the ninth
wicket fell. The last man came in, and after a couple of
overs the visitors&rsquo; umpire announced, as he came up to the
wicket, &ldquo;Last over.&rdquo; Everyone who had a watch on looked
at it, and saw that it was only 6.20; the large clock fixed on
the base of the flagstaff in the corner of the ground, however,
said 6.30 within a minute or so. The over was bowled, with
no result, and the aforesaid umpire calmly took the bails off,
and walked off the ground.</p>

<p>Then there was a row. <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> captain pointed out
that the clock was wrong, and that there was nearly ten
minutes more play; the umpire maintained that they were
bound to go by the ground clock, and was not at all sporting
about it. <i>Britannia&rsquo;s</i> captain, being a man in authority, gave
him a good slice of his naval executive mind, but the umpire
was stubborn, and time was fleeting. Luckily, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
visitors&rsquo; captain, who was changing in the pavilion, was a
sportsman of different kidney; and he immediately decreed,
upon being appealed to, that, time or no time, the innings
should be played out. So the recalcitrant umpire, and the
batsmen, who had taken off their pads, had to come back
again, and one of them was so long about it that the bowler
did not realise that he had not arrived until he had commenced
his run, and found that he was attacking an empty
wicket! So, amid some merriment, the batsman at length
got fixed up, and a few balls sufficed to decide the match, the
last man being dismissed, just on the stroke of time, by a
clever catch in the slips.</p>

<p>Moral: Have your ground clock kept right.</p>

<p>The season of 1903 has been a most successful one, as the
following figures testify:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First eleven.&mdash;Played, 19: won, 15; drawn, 3; lost, 0 (one abandoned).<br />
Second eleven.&mdash;Played, 22: won, 14; lost, 7; drawn, 1.<br />
Third eleven.&mdash;Played, 12: won, 9; lost, 1; drawn, 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the remarkable performance of two cadets
in a third eleven match, mentioned above, it is on record
that Dr. Bobardt on one occasion scored 39 runs off two
consecutive overs; that Lieutenant de Burgh made what is
believed to be the record score for <i>Britannia</i> of 229 not out
(he also scored on another occasion 177 not out); and, the
bowlers being determined not to be left out in the cold, the
&ldquo;hat trick&rdquo; has been performed five times, the Rev. H. Royse,
the chaplain, doing it twice.</p>

<p>Enough has been said, perhaps, about the games to
indicate what an important place they are assigned in the
general programme of the <i>Britannia</i>, and with what keenness
and uniform success they are pursued. As the editor remarks,
in the opening number of the magazine, no school has such
a variety of fixtures; &ldquo;we want a whole <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life</i> to
ourselves,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>The playing fields could scarcely be surpassed, one would
imagine: a good idea of their extent and quality and also
of the amount of work entailed in their construction may
be obtained from the illustrations. That high bank which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
separates the two cricket grounds, and the smaller one at
the further side of the upper ground, mean a lot of navvies&rsquo;
work; but no expense or trouble has been spared in the
matter, the Admiralty possibly holding the view that if, as
was said by a great soldier, British military victories are won
on the playing fields at Eton, they are not going to give the
Navy any excuse for not winning victories on the score of
inefficient playing fields! Certainly, money so expended is
money well spent. Since the early days of the <i>Britannia</i>
a complete revolution has taken place in the matter of
recognised recreation for both soldiers and sailors&mdash;officers and
men. Formerly they had to do as best they could, by private
subscriptions, both for indoor and outdoor games; now
a large sum is voted annually for the purpose, and the
<i>Britannia</i> games and playing fields bear witness that the
Admiralty is not behind the times in this respect.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>AVING followed the story of the <i>Britannia</i> from her
cradle&mdash;but not to her grave, as interment would be
premature at present&mdash;it only remains to add a few
details and remarks on the general arrangements as now
existing, and on the results of the work performed in the
training of young officers during the period of forty-six years
since the institution of the <i>Illustrious</i> under Captain Harris,
together with a brief description of the new scheme which is
now in operation, concurrently with the last days of the
<i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>The arrangements and general condition of the two ships
which constitute the establishment, as the result of many
years of experience and successive improvements under
various captains, are such as to impress most favourably
anyone who has had experience in naval discipline and the
adaptation of ships to such purposes. Whatever may be the
views held by various officers and others as to the advisability
of using a stationary ship in preference to a college&mdash;and
they are many and diverse, as we have seen&mdash;there can be
but one opinion as to the high state of perfection which has
been attained in the <i>Britannia</i>, whether from a sanitary,
a disciplinary, or an educational point of view.</p>

<p>The cadets&rsquo; chests and hammocks are divided between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
two ships&mdash;which are, of course, practically one, by virtue of
the connecting bridge&mdash;the first and second terms being
located on the lower deck of the <i>Hindostan</i>, the third and
fourth on the main deck of the <i>Britannia</i>. At the fore end
of each of these decks are large salt water baths, with fresh
water shower-baths; every cadet, on turning out in the
morning, has to go through the bath, and is also provided
with hot water at his washing place for supplementary
ablutions. Arrangements are also made by which about one
hundred cadets get a hot fresh water bath each week. The
hot and muddy followers of the beagles are not forgotten,
a very acceptable warm bath being provided for them when
they return on board.</p>

<p>The cadets&rsquo; chests and clothes are under supervision by
the lieutenant in charge of each term, who supplies the
captain with a list of deficiencies once a month, and frequently
inspects the chests and clothing, to see that they are kept in
good order.</p>

<p>Naval uniform, etc., is very strictly prescribed nowadays,
down to the most minute details&mdash;such as neckties, and toe-caps
on boots&mdash;in great contrast to the laxity of former days;
and the cadets are bound by these to the very letter.</p>

<p>The studies are divided between the two ships, and are
as good as they could be made on board a ship; gangways
are built at the sides, so as to utilise the full breadth of the
ship, without the necessity of passing through one study
for access to another. The lecture-room is on board the
<i>Britannia</i>, fitted with rising tiers of seats, and all appliances
for practical demonstration in physics, etc.</p>

<p>The messroom is on the lower deck of the <i>Britannia</i>; and
a bulkhead separates this and the steward&rsquo;s pantries, etc.,
from the ship&rsquo;s company&rsquo;s quarters at the fore end.</p>

<p>The wardroom officers have an excellent messroom at the
after end of the middle deck, with anteroom and billiard-room.
It may sound odd to landsmen to hear of such
a nicely adjusted article as a billiard-table on board ship; and,
of course, in a sea-going ship or one moored in an exposed
position it would be futile. In a close and quiet harbour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
such as Dartmouth, however, it is quite feasible, and any
little alterations in the trim of the ship are compensated by
means of a screw on each leg of the table and a spirit level.</p>

<p>The captain has his quarters on the main deck, above the
officers.</p>

<p>The poop of the <i>Hindostan</i> is roofed in and fitted permanently
as a chapel, the only adaptation necessary for Sunday
being the covering of the skylights which light the studies
below, and which otherwise interfere with the arrangement of
the seats. This is a vast improvement
on the old style of
&ldquo;rigging church&rdquo; with messroom
forms, etc., on the middle
deck, which is all very well
in a sea-going ship, where you
cannot devote a portion of a
deck to the purpose.</p>

<p class="caption">CAPTAIN C.&nbsp;H. CROSS.</p>
</div>

<p>The upper deck of the
<i>Britannia</i> is covered in, and
used as a place for recreation
and skylarking in bad weather,
also for such functions as prize
day, etc.</p>

<p>There are two floating
swimming baths attached to
the ship: one is moored a little
way off, and the other, in which
the water can be heated when necessary, is secured under the
bridge which connects the two ships. These are used for the
purpose of instruction in swimming; every cadet is tested as
to his capabilities in this respect on joining; should the
weather be too cold at the time, he must produce a statement
from his parents or guardian that he can swim. The test is
to swim sixty yards without stopping; any boy who is unable
to do this is placed under instruction, and his progress
regularly reported until he can pass in swimming. No cadet
is allowed to use the boats for recreation, or to present himself
for final examination, unless he is able to swim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The first paragraph of the regulations to be observed by
cadets when away from the ship explains clearly enough the
spirit in which the rules are imposed:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cadets when on shore for recreation enjoy complete
freedom from surveillance. This advantage can only be
enjoyed with their co-operation, and it is obviously to their
interest, in every way, to show that the confidence reposed in
them is not misplaced. Certain rules and regulations are
laid down for their guidance, and they are &lsquo;<em>on their honour</em>&rsquo;
to abide by them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rules are by no means too harsh or exacting, and the
system is found to work perfectly.</p>

<p>The youth &ldquo;Navilus,&rdquo; in his booklet, it will be recollected,
records how he and his companion went on board the German
man-of-war. This was a breach of rules, without first obtaining
permission, but not a very terrible offence; indeed, it would
have been almost too much to expect that they should, in
response to such a cordial invitation, reply that they were
not permitted to do so.</p>

<p>The course of studies and seamanship as at present
pursued is contained in the Appendix, and needs but little
notice here.</p>

<p>It will be observed that instructions as to working sails
and masts, man&oelig;uvring a ship under sail, etc., are wiped out;
all that is taught is the names of sails and how to &ldquo;bend&rdquo;
fore and aft sails. All fitting of rigging is also abolished, and
only such bends and hitches, knots and splices, retained as
may be occasionally useful. It was quite time, no doubt, to
take this step, seeing how much else there is to learn, and that
none of these lads will ever see a sail set in their future
ships; still, there is a certain feeling of regret about it.
England attained her unrivalled place on the ocean by her
sailors&rsquo; smartness in the old style of seamanship; she will
have to maintain it with the new appliances when the time
comes.</p>

<p>Another source of regret&mdash;entirely sentimental, no doubt;
but are not sailors proverbially sentimental?&mdash;is the final
disappearance of the big ship under a cloud of canvas. Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
a sight as the cadets were called from their studies to witness
one day at Portland, when the <i>Revenge</i>, a very handsome
two-decker, was beating into the roads; Captain Harris stood on
the poop, a veritable sea-dog, and criticised every movement.</p>

<p>A big battleship or cruiser is a fine sight, the embodiment
of power and dangerous energy; but she cannot hold a candle
to the <i>Revenge</i> as a picture!</p>

<p>In 1902 great excitement was caused by the news that
the <i>Racer</i> was doomed; and in due course her successor put
in an appearance&mdash;a very different sort of craft.</p>

<p>The <i>Isis</i> is a second-class cruiser of 5,600 tons and 8,000
horse-power, though she is capable of developing a good deal
more than this when it is found necessary to press her. She
is reckoned as a 19-&nbsp;or 20-knot vessel, and, as will be seen
from the illustration, is a very business-like looking craft,
presenting quite an imposing appearance in the narrow
waters of the Dart.</p>

<p>Her first cruise commenced on October 2nd, 1902, when
she took the fourth term cadets to sea for a blue-water
cruise; the first since the days of the <i>Ariadne</i> in the early
&rsquo;seventies. It was during this trip that, while at Santa Cruz,
in Teneriffe, some idiotic Canary Islanders attacked Captain
Mundy, and injured him rather seriously.</p>

<p>The <i>Isis</i>, however, did not provide sufficient accommodation
for the cadets who were ripe for sea training, so another
vessel was attached to the <i>Britannia</i>&mdash;the <i>Aurora</i>, an older
vessel, and, though of the same tonnage and lower speed,
rated as a first-class cruiser; she has a considerable amount
of protective armour.</p>

<p>These two vessels are kept going, and in the summer
number of the magazine for 1903 there is quite a long yarn
about their doings, with scores of the cricket matches played
by the cadets at various ports.</p>

<p>When the cadets joined for their cruise on May 7th, 1903,
at Plymouth, it is recorded that all turned up punctually
except one boy, whose parents had sent him to Portsmouth
by mistake; and, as he came from Wales, he had rather
a roundabout journey to Plymouth!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
They visited the Scilly Isles, where Mr. Smith-Dorrien,
who owns large property there, extended liberal hospitality to
them. Here a somewhat awkward mishap attended two of
the lieutenants. They went out in a skiff, when the weather
became somewhat rough&mdash;as everyone knows it can at the
Scillies&mdash;and their small craft capsized, out of sight of the
ship. However, they managed to swim on shore, and were
well looked after by a fisherman&rsquo;s family until a ship&rsquo;s boat
brought them on board, luckily none the worse.</p>

<p>From the Scillies they went to Milford Haven, thence to
the Isle of Man, and on to Oban. They were to have gone
on to the &ldquo;Land of the Midnight Sun,&rdquo; but one of the lads
had to be landed for an operation for appendicitis, so their
stay at Oban was prolonged, and the Norway trip abandoned.</p>

<p>Two of the ship&rsquo;s boats took part in a sailing race, and
the gig of the <i>Isis</i>, steered by the first lieutenant, succeeded
in carrying off the prize, being, indeed, 18 minutes ahead
of her time allowance; which must have astonished the
members of the local yacht club who admitted them to the
competition; for it is, curiously enough, a sort of axiom
among yachtsmen, that naval officers cannot sail a boat.</p>

<p>From Oban they went to Invergordon, Tobermory, and
Stornoway. But the weather-god of the Hebrides is an
unrestful sort of person, and treated them to a little of the
bluster which he always has up his sleeve, even in the
summer months; and before they arrived at Milford Haven,
on July 5th, a good many of the cadets had had a good
opportunity of getting their &ldquo;sea-legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All naval officers who have visited Scotland in their
cruises carry away pleasing recollections of much kindness
and hospitality, and the experience of the officers and cadets
on board the <i>Isis</i> formed no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The <i>Aurora</i>, meanwhile, sailing on the same day, visited
Guernsey, Yarmouth (Isle of Wight), Weymouth, Torquay,
Falmouth, the Scilly Isles, Kingstown, Bangor, Lamlash Bay
(in the Isle of Arran), thence to the Isle of Man, and finally
to Milford Haven, where they found their &ldquo;opposite number,&rdquo;
the <i>Isis</i>, and compared notes as to their respective cruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
It is quite obvious, from the tone of the letters from the
two ships, that these cruises, teeming as they do with opportunities
of acquiring valuable knowledge and experience, are
also a source of much pleasure and enjoyment to the lads.</p>

<p>It is recorded in the magazine that the captain has started
a shooting class among the cadets of the senior term; giving
preference to those who have not had an opportunity at
home of using a fowling piece. Clay pigeons are provided,
and the cadets are instructed in all the precautions which
should be used when out shooting, so as to minimise the risk
of accident. This is an excellent idea, and the boys ought
to be very grateful to Captain Cross for originating it. Every
shooting season has its tale of accidents, many of them
arising from an utter disregard of precautions and lack of
common sense; opportunities often occur of shooting on
foreign stations, and the experience gained with the clay
pigeons at Dartmouth will come in handy afterwards, no
doubt. The practice of dragging a loaded gun through
a hedge is responsible for many deaths, the culprit being
usually also the victim; and the extraordinary things that
people who are supposed to be experts in the use of fire-arms
will do sometimes are almost incredible. Let us hope that
these young gentlemen, being forewarned, will learn the value
of caution and common sense in the use of both sporting and
service weapons; not forgetting the revolver, which, in
the hands of careless or incompetent persons, is the most
dangerous weapon of all.</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s Birthday &ldquo;whole&rdquo; was curtailed to a &ldquo;half&rdquo;
in 1903, owing to the presence of scarlet fever in Dartmouth;
but, as it was held on June 26th, the day was long, and was
well filled up. Three cricket matches, a picnic of about 140
up the river, and a sea-fishing party of forty or fifty comprised
the entertainments, which were all eminently successful.
The fishermen were piloted by Mr. James, of Dartmouth, to
an ideal fishing ground, where they hauled up many big fish,
including huge conger eels&mdash;which often give exciting sport
by their antics when landed, getting mixed up with all the
tackle in the boat, and going for the fishermen open-mouthed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
when they endeavour to disentangle them&mdash;rock-cod, and
other marine monsters; they also had a parallel experience
with that of the apostolic fisherman of old, for, though they
were not using nets, one of their best lines broke from the
weight of fish upon it.</p>

<p>The spot selected by this acute Dartmouth gentleman
presents a strong contrast to some places which are marked
&ldquo;good fishing&rdquo; on the Admiralty charts, where, indeed, the
words hold good in an ironical sense, for you may fish all day
there; but, whether your fishing be good, bad, or indifferent,
there is no &ldquo;catching&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Before proceeding to describe the arrangements which are
to supersede the old <i>Britannia</i> course, it may be interesting
to give a few figures showing the numbers who have passed
through the ship. These are not available earlier than
January 1st, 1862.</p>

<p>Since that date the number of cadets actually entered, up
to the close of 1902, is 5,009; the number who have presented
themselves for final examination out of the ship, from December,
1862, to August, 1903, is 4,741; and out of these there
have been 151 failures&mdash;3&middot;1 per cent.</p>

<p>This is not a large percentage over so long a period; but
taking the last ten years separately there is a very marked
improvement, 1,770 cadets examined giving only 27 failures,
or 1&frac12; per cent.; and the last five examinations&mdash;up to August,
1903&mdash;have brought no failures.</p>

<p>There is no record easily available as to the numbers withdrawn,
or discharged, for misconduct, earlier than midsummer,
1879; since then, up to August, 1903, 79 have been withdrawn,
and eleven discharged for misconduct, or 2&middot;9 per cent.
in all; and these numbers include six who were discharged at
the time of the bullying investigation, during Captain Digby&rsquo;s
command.</p>

<p>During the last ten years, however, only 1&middot;6 per cent. have
left before completing their course, there being only one case
of dismissal for misconduct.</p>

<p>Since 1884, 66 cadets have entered the Service from the
two training-ships of the Mercantile Marine Service Association,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
the <i>Conway</i> in the Mersey, and the <i>Worcester</i> in the
Thames. These lads, after two years in the training ships,
provided they fulfil certain conditions as to age, etc., are
admitted for examination with the cadets in the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Some details as to the cost of the <i>Britannia</i> will be found
in the Appendix; the figures are
high, and do not include the cost of
the sea-going training ships now in
commission, which is not small.</p>

<p class="caption">MR. J.&nbsp;H. SPANTON.</p>
</div>

<p>If the gross amount named in
the estimates be taken, without deducting
the parents&rsquo; contributions,
the rate per head per annum in
1882-3 would be &pound;258, and in
1901-2 &pound;187. Whether this is
excessive in respect of what is
obtained for it, or how it compares
with the cost per head at the most
expensive public schools, it is not
precisely within the scope of this volume to inquire; but
probably a ship school of the high type of the <i>Britannia</i> is
a very expensive affair, and, after all, when the amount of the
Navy estimates, year by year, is taken into consideration,
forty or fifty thousand pounds does not seem an extravagant
sum to pay for the training of executive officers: it will
come a good deal heavier in the future, however.</p>

<p>The course of study will be found in the Appendix; but
something should be said about the masters and their work.</p>

<p>The instructional staff consists of the chief naval instructor,
eight naval instructors, two French masters, two
drawing masters, one English master, and one natural science
master.</p>

<p>Of these, Mr. J.&nbsp;H. Spanton, the senior drawing master,
has been 36 years in the ship; Mr. P. Brunel, the senior
French master, 28 years; Mr. Hamilton Williams, the English
master, 27 years; and Mr. Tims, the chief naval instructor,
is in his twentieth year. In the past, there have been several
naval instructors who have remained for over 20 years&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
wit, Mr. A.&nbsp;C. Johnson, 24 years; the Rev. J.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;P. Aldous,
23 years; Mr. W.&nbsp;W. Lane, 22 years; Mr. G.&nbsp;B. Mason,
22 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Aldous, it will be recollected, was appointed, in 1875,
as chief naval instructor, though he had never been connected
with the Service in any capacity; during his long
tenure of office he retained the goodwill of all his colleagues,
and entirely justified his selection by the Admiralty for this
important post.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson was&mdash;and is&mdash;an enthusiast in the science of
navigation, and has published several books on the subject,
one of which&mdash;on finding the position of the ship at sea, by
observations, in cloudy weather&mdash;has run into over five-and-twenty
editions. He also edited a text-book on trigonometry
for the use of the cadets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 185px;">

<p class="caption">MR. G.&nbsp;B. MASON.</p>
</div>

<p>The cadets are divided into two watches, and those who
join each term are divided into two classes, half of each class
being in either watch. Thus, if
64 cadets join in one term, they
would be known as first and
second class starboard and first
and second class port; and as one
watch is always &ldquo;out of study&rdquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
at seamanship or other
work&mdash;the class actually present
with the naval instructor would
number sixteen. A cadet captain
has charge of this sixteen, and
has to see that they enter and
leave the study quietly, and pay
due attention to whatever work
they may be about, in the absence
of the instructor.</p>

<p>There is also an excellent arrangement by which the boys
of each class have to inform their captain every evening how
they have employed their leisure time; and this has to be
accounted for under numerous headings on a regular form
provided for the purpose, and covering a week, Sunday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
excepted. Thus, so many will be swimming, or photographing,
walking, playing cricket, tennis, racquets, fives, etc.; or out in
sailing boats or blue gigs, and so on; 23 headings in all,
including &ldquo;punishment,&rdquo; the total number in the last column
showing that all the class have been accounted for each day;
and this form is presented to the captain on Sunday.</p>

<p>The cadet captains are by this means made to feel
that they have certain responsibilities, while it constitutes
a decided check on aimless loafing, which is a bad thing
for all boys.</p>

<p>It is now time to take leave of the <i>Britannia</i>. Her story
has been followed pretty closely for 46 years, from the day on
which Captain Harris received his first batch of cadets on
board the <i>Illustrious</i>; and it is hoped that the life on board
and the various vicissitudes of the ship under successive
administrations have been described with sufficient accuracy
to give a true picture of this institution&mdash;an institution which
has had a bearing and influence upon the efficiency of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
Navy during all these years, the importance of which can
scarcely be overrated.</p>

<p>Sir William Martin stated nothing but the truth when he
wrote to Captain Harris, in 1861: &ldquo;There is no man in
England whose opportunity of doing good to our country, for
ages to come, is greater than yours.&rdquo; And if it was true in
regard to Captain Harris, it must be held to be equally
applicable to his successors in command, and, in a lesser
degree, to the large number of officers and masters who have
assisted them.</p>

<p>How have they discharged this heavy responsibility?</p>

<p>It is impossible to pass a verdict otherwise than favourable
on the whole, keeping in mind, of course, the fact that
those immediately responsible for the conduct of the establishment
were always under orders, with regard to general
principles, from the Admiralty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
Mistakes may have been made at headquarters, errors in
discipline, teaching, and so on, may have crept in on board
from time to time. To err is human, and a great administrative
department such as the British Admiralty must, of necessity,
deal largely in compromises. You cannot find, on this earth,
any corporation, institution, or structure which combines the
highest degree of excellence in all the attributes which go
to make up its composition; and in the conduct of the
<i>Britannia</i> there must always have been conflicting elements
difficult to reconcile.</p>

<p>Taking it all round, however, the general conclusion must
be that the <i>Britannia</i> has done right well, and that those
who have been responsible for her management have done
their best in the interests of the Service.</p>

<p>That no pains have been spared in perfecting equipment,
organisation, discipline, recreation, must be patent to all
who have taken the trouble to read these pages&mdash;otherwise
they have certainly been written in vain&mdash;and if any further
proof be needed, a visit to Dartmouth will dispel all doubts.</p>

<p>The visit must not be delayed too long, however; the last
days of the <i>Britannia</i> are approaching, and in a year or two
the familiar twin hulls, with the connecting bridge, and the
flotilla of steam and sailing boats clustered about them, will
have disappeared. The last batch of cadets under the old
regulations will be entered in November, 1905; and it is
probable that, if space permit, they will be housed in the
College now rising on the hill, while the ship may be kept on
for a time as an overflow, or as a store for marine appliances,
etc.</p>

<p>The old gives place to the new; but for many years to
come there will remain hundreds of officers who will look
back with pleasure on their life at Dartmouth, and who will
ungrudgingly acknowledge the many valuable lessons they
learned in the &ldquo;good old <i>Brit.</i>&rdquo;</p>


<p class="break">A few concluding words are necessary in order to describe
the new system which is to take the place of the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>Years ago, when the Naval Academy was first instituted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
the question of the necessity, or at least the advisability, of
some previous training for boys, before sending them to sea,
was mooted. In those days it was partial, a large number
continuing to join their ships straight from school; then
the scheme was dropped for twenty years, until Captain
Harris came to the front, and previous training was made
compulsory.</p>

<p>There were many dissentient voices at that time, and for
years subsequently there were not wanting those who maintained
that more efficient officers would ultimately be obtained
upon what we have alluded to as the &ldquo;pitchfork&rdquo; system.</p>

<p>Time, with its abnormally rapid changes of the last century,
has, however, solved the problem&mdash;as it eventually solves all
questions&mdash;and he would be a bold man, and a somewhat
foolish one withal, who would venture nowadays to advocate
a policy of no previous training.</p>

<p>The new regulations are of a revolutionary character, and&mdash;without
going into the merits of the question with regard
to the amalgamation, during probation, of the executive
officers, Engineers, and Marine officers, which has raised some
discussion&mdash;the principal points are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>The average age of entry is between 12 and 13.</p>

<p>All candidates are admitted, as before, by the nomination
of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>All are liable, at the expiration of their training, to be
placed on the strength as sub-lieutenants, Engineer sub-lieutenants,
or subalterns of Marines, as may be required; but
the wishes of each officer will be consulted as far as is compatible
with the needs of the Service.</p>

<p>In giving nominations, preference will be given, other
things being equal, to those applicants whose parents or
guardians declare for them that they are prepared to enter
any of the three branches.</p>

<p>In the first circular issued, a competitive examination of a
stiff character was provided for; by a subsequent amendment,
however, this has been replaced by a qualifying examination,
not of a very formidable nature. So it is to be hoped that the
anomaly of bestowing a number of nominations, two-thirds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
which cannot possibly come to anything, is to be finally
relegated to the past.</p>

<p>Examinations will be held three times each year, preceded
by a medical examination, the subjects being as follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part I.</span></p>

<p class="hang">1. English (including writing from dictation, simple composition, and
reproduction of the gist of a short passage twice read aloud to the
candidates).</p>

<p class="hang">2. History and geography:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">(<i>a</i>) History (simple questions in English history and growth of
the British Empire).</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>b</i>) Geography (simple questions with special reference to the
British Empire).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="hang">3. French or German (importance will be attached to the oral
examination).</p>

<p class="hang">4. Arithmetic and algebra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="hang">(<i>a</i>) Arithmetic (elementary, including vulgar and decimal fractions).</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>b</i>) Algebra (to simple equations with easy problems).</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="hang">5. Geometry (to include the subject matter of the first book of Euclid,
or its equivalent in experimental geometry and mensuration).</p>

<p class="hang">The use of instruments and of algebraical methods will be allowed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Part II.</span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>One only to be taken.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">6. Latin (easy passages for translation from Latin into English, and
from English into Latin, and simple grammatical questions).</p>

<p class="hang">7. A second modern language (of which, if not French or German,
notice must be previously given), or an advanced examination in
the language selected under Part I.</p>

<p class="hang">8. Experimental science (easy questions with the object of testing
practical knowledge and powers of observation).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On passing this examination candidates will be sent to the
training establishments for four years.</p>

<p>Instruction will comprise an extension of the present
<i>Britannia</i> course, and a thorough elementary instruction in
physics, marine engineering, etc., including the use of tools
and machines. Instruction will also be carried out in small
vessels attached to the establishment.</p>

<p>Examinations will be held during the second and fourth
year of training. Cadets who fail to pass will be withdrawn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
Parents or guardians are required to sign a declaration on the
admission of a cadet to the training establishment to the effect
that he shall be immediately withdrawn on the receipt of an
official intimation of his being considered unfit for the Navy.</p>

<p>After leaving the training establishment cadets will go to
sea, and will then be instructed in seamanship, navigation,
pilotage, gunnery, mechanics, and engineering by the specialised
officers of the ship.</p>

<p>After three years, each midshipman who has passed the
qualifying examinations will become an acting sub-lieutenant.</p>

<p>Acting sub-lieutenants go to Greenwich Royal Naval
College and to Portsmouth for final instruction in the subjects
they studied while midshipmen at sea.</p>

<p>On conclusion of their examination in these subjects,
having reached the age of 19 or 20, sub-lieutenants will be
distributed between the executive and engineer branches of
the Navy and the Royal Marines. No sub-lieutenant will be
required to join any branch for which he did not enter as a
boy when applying for a nomination.</p>

<p>Such are, briefly, the regulations under which&mdash;simultaneously
with those who, between 14&frac12; and 15&frac12; years of age,
are going in for the last of the old system&mdash;cadets are now
being entered.</p>

<p>The training establishments alluded to consist of the
colleges at Dartmouth and Osborne, with such steam vessels
as may be necessary for instruction afloat.</p>

<p>The Dartmouth College is, however, very far from being
completed, but our illustration gives a truthful picture of its
future appearance.</p>

<p>It is reproduced from an original drawing, kindly lent by
Mr. Aston Webb, R.A., the architect.</p>

<p>The Dartmouth College has some pretensions, as has been
seen, to artistic merit in appearance, and will, in fact, be
a very handsome and effective building on its commanding
site.</p>

<p>Those who look for anything of this nature at Osborne
will, however, be grievously disappointed. The College in the
Isle of Wight is utilitarian to the last degree; so much so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
as to render any criticism of the buildings from an artistic
point of view quite out of the question.</p>

<p>There is a reason for this, however; and the reason is
that it had to be prepared for the reception of the first batch
of cadets under the new scheme in July, 1903; and at the
beginning of that year it had literally no existence.</p>

<p>Having decided upon the adoption of this scheme, and
deeming it imperative that it should be brought into operation
as speedily as possible, the Admiralty had no option but
to &ldquo;rush&rdquo; the College into existence; and the King having
sanctioned its erection at Osborne, it was rushed accordingly.
Sir John Fisher, who had this arrangement in hand, and
very much at heart, is perhaps better qualified for getting the
maximum amount of work done in the minimum time than
any officer in the Service.</p>

<p class="caption">THE OLD STABLE YARD, OSBORNE.</p>
</div>

<p>The stables at Osborne House formed the nucleus of the
new building; and in close proximity to these&mdash;which were
promptly adopted for various purposes&mdash;there were run up
a series of bungalow erections&mdash;dormitories, officers&rsquo; quarters,
and so on&mdash;constructed of timber and a kind of hard plaster
known as &ldquo;uralite.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="caption">THE NEW COLLEGE, DARTMOUTH.<br />
<i>From the Design by Aston Webb, R.A.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The illustrations give a correct idea of their general
appearance; and though, as has been observed, they are
utilitarian rather than ornamental, they are very well fitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"><!-- blank page --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
in every way, and quite up to date. There are twenty-five
beds in a dormitory, and room for a few more if necessary;
each cadet&rsquo;s chest stands at the foot of his bed, and a wash-stand
beside it; there is a plunge bath, with three ordinary
ones, at the end of the dormitory, and a capital lavatory
besides, for use in the daytime.</p>

<p>The officers&rsquo; quarters are very comfortable and well
furnished, and the cabins are of sufficiently liberal dimensions
to be dignified by the name of rooms.</p>

<p>The whole establishment is lit by electric light, the
current being brought from Newport at a high voltage, and
transformed at East Cowes, so as to be delivered at 240
volts.</p>

<p>The playing fields are very large in extent&mdash;much larger
than those at Dartmouth&mdash;and though they are now somewhat
in the rough, they will in time be excellent, the subsoil
being gravel and the drainage consequently very good.</p>

<p>The officers of the Osborne College are to be found in
the &ldquo;Navy List&rdquo; under our old friend the <i>Racer</i>, formerly
attached as a rigged cruising vessel to the <i>Britannia</i>, but
now denuded of her yards and sails, and used as an instructional
ship for the College.</p>

<p>Captain R.&nbsp;E. Wemyss is in command at Osborne, and his
staff comprises a commander, four lieutenants, two engineer
lieutenants, and an engineer sub-lieutenant, a captain Royal
Marine Artillery, chaplain, staff surgeon, surgeon, staff paymaster,
and assistant paymaster, besides some warrant officers
and petty officers for instructional and disciplinary purposes.</p>

<p>There are also eight masters for studies, who do not,
however, at present reside in the College, but have a comfortable
sitting-room appropriated to them.</p>

<p>More dormitories, etc., are in course of construction, in
anticipation of a considerable increase of numbers in the
near future.</p>

<p>This does not, however, include the whole establishment,
for down by the river-side, about three-quarters of a mile
distant, there is an excellent workshop, with all necessary
machines of the latest description, run by electric motors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
This was also run up in record time, but is built of brick,
and in every respect most workmanlike and suitable for its
purpose.</p>

<p>There are&mdash;in October, 1903&mdash;about eighty cadets, whose
course is in full swing, and who appear to be thoroughly
happy and comfortable, and keen about work and play alike.</p>

<p>The workshop appears to possess a tremendous attraction
for them; and, judging by the eagerness with which they
race for their places and tackle the tools, practical mechanics
is not going to be a difficulty in the new scheme.</p>

<p>A substantial pier is being constructed on the river, and
various improvements are being rapidly carried out.</p>

<p>How the course is to be apportioned between the two
Colleges is not precisely settled at present; but it is almost
certain that the cadets will commence at one&mdash;probably
Osborne&mdash;and, after two years or so, be transferred to the
other to complete their course.</p>

<p>Such is briefly the educational arrangement for our future
naval officers; the scheme excited a good deal of adverse
comment when it was announced, and only experience, of
course, can demonstrate its merits and defects. It has been
inaugurated with a great deal of energy, and certainly appears
to promise well, at any rate in the probationary stage. With
later developments, which some people predict will bring a
certain degree of failure, we are not concerned just now. It
is obvious, however, that some radical change was necessary,
and half measures are seldom successful; so it is as well,
perhaps, that the authorities have &ldquo;taken the bull by the
horns,&rdquo; and had the courage of their convictions.</p>

<br />
<span class="vsmlfont">(<i>From &ldquo;BRITANNIA&rdquo; REGULATIONS, 1876.</i>)</span></h2>


<h3 class="smcap">Regulations Respecting Cadets While Under Training.</h3>

<p>(1) The naval cadets who join the <i>Britannia</i> are allowed four terms
(two in each year) to complete their course of study, at the expiration
of which they go up for final examination.</p>

<p>(2) The terms are from about February 1st to July 15th, and from
about August 31st to December 20th; and the vacations will be six
weeks at midsummer, five weeks at Christmas, and two weeks at
Easter, the dates of commencement of vacation depending upon the
completion of the examinations by the President, Royal Naval College,
Greenwich.</p>

<p>(3) The friends of the cadets must be prepared to receive them
during all the vacations.</p>

<p>(4) The following payment will be required from the parents or
guardians of each cadet while in the <i>Britannia</i>:&mdash;Before the commencement
of each term, &pound;35, except in the case of those received at
the reduced rate of &pound;40 a year, whose half-yearly payments will be &pound;20
only.</p>

<p>(5) The payments are to be made according to instructions which
will be given in the half-yearly claim that will be made by the
Accountant-General upon the parents or guardians of the cadets.</p>

<p>(6) Great inconvenience having been experienced from these payments
not having been punctually made, cadets, although received until
their friends are communicated with, will not be considered as entered
for tuition until the amounts due have been received.</p>

<p>(7) All travelling expenses for cadets will be advanced by the paymaster
of the <i>Britannia</i>, who will charge the same to the cadet&rsquo;s
personal account at the end of each term.</p>

<p>(8) The cadets have a weekly allowance, and all expenses attending
their amusements are paid for by the ship. It is, therefore, requested
that their friends do not give them any money except on joining or on
their return from the vacations, and then the amount must not exceed
ten shillings. It is particularly requested that this regulation be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
adhered to. Such money as may be required by a cadet for any special
circumstances will be advanced by the paymaster under the authority
of the captain of the <i>Britannia</i>.</p>

<p>(9) It is particularly requested that the cadets bring their linen
clean and clothes and boots in good order when they join the ship, and
also when they return from leave, and that the outfit as required be
complete.</p>

<p>(10) Cadets are not permitted to open an account with tradesmen.
Parents and guardians are, therefore, requested to pay no bills that may
be sent to them.</p>

<p>(11) Should there have been any infectious disease in the house
where the cadets have been staying during their holidays, notice of the
circumstance is to be given to the commanding officer of H.M.S.
<i>Britannia</i>; and they are not to join until they have received a
communication from him to that effect.</p>

<p>(12) All letters relative to the cadets should be addressed as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The Commanding Officer, H.M.S. <i>Britannia</i>, Dartmouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(13) Should cadets bring valuable gold watches or chains with them
to the training ship, they will be taken from them and placed in
security until they return to their homes. Silver watches will be
allowed to be used.</p>

<p>(14) Parents or guardians of cadets must in all cases of permanent
change of residence communicate the same to the captain of the
training ship without delay.</p>

<p><i>THE SPECTATOR says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A book which is both instructive and entertaining.... The
story is relieved by various amusing anecdotes, and, more seriously, by
notices of some distinguished foreigners who have made use of the
Academy, the Prince Imperial being, perhaps, the best known....
Excellent illustrations.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE DAILY CHRONICLE says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The writer of a military school history runs the risk of having to
fill many pages with technical details of changes of organisation and
regulations which have little interest for the average reader. Captain
Guggisberg has avoided this pitfall. While the story of the gradual
development of the college is duly set forth in his book, he gives greater
prominence throughout to the social and human side of the life of
&lsquo;The Shop.&rsquo;... It is written in a bright and interesting style
throughout, and the author&rsquo;s descriptions are helped by a series of
illustrations, many of them in colours, which help us to realise the
changes that more than a century has seen at Woolwich.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>VANITY FAIR says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For such a book as this there are thousands of readers scattered
over the world to welcome the record of the place where they first
underwent the discipline of their profession. The author has spared
no trouble to make his book interesting from all points of view....
Safe to prophesy success to this venture.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE ACADEMY says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those who wish to know how it (&lsquo;The Shop&rsquo;) prospered in the
18th century, during the great war with France, and through the 19th
century to our own day, must be referred to Captain Guggisberg&rsquo;s
fascinating pages, where they will find everything set out in full....
Valuable appendices deal with the officers, staff, and sport at &lsquo;The
Shop&rsquo;; and in the roll of honour will be found some notable names.
Many of the illustrations are in colour.... The majority are from
photographs very well reproduced.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE ATHEN&AElig;UM says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Guggisberg traces the history with considerable minuteness....
Illustrations specially good and well chosen; indeed,
author and publishers may both be congratulated.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE UNITED SERVICE GAZETTE says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This admirable history of the Royal Military Academy will be
very welcome.... Even the reader who has not the honour of
belonging to either of the ordnance corps will find the book most
interesting reading.... Finally, the illustrations alone would
render the book very valuable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE MORNING POST says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The illustrations generally are excellent, the history has been
compiled with judgment, and the book will be found attractive even
outside the famous corps whose nursery it depicts.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>NAVY AND ARMY says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most entertaining and instructive account.... He tells
the later story of the Academy in much detail and in a very interesting
manner.... Illustrated by excellent photographs.... The
coloured illustrations are very good, and the whole book is attractively
got up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>THE DAILY NEWS says</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very readable history.... The Asmodeus who takes us
behind the scenes of the Academy is an interesting guide, and by the
time we have read his pages, which, by the way, are very well illustrated,
we have got an excellent idea of the life of the Woolwich cadet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>From &ldquo;Proceedings of the R.A. Institution&rdquo;</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story of &lsquo;The Shop&rsquo; has been admirably told in the smart
little volume ... told clearly and succinctly. All important events
are mentioned, yet none are over accentuated; and the book from start
to finish is most readable and interesting.... Admirably got up.
Paper, printing, illustrations, and binding are all as good as possible.&rdquo;</p>
